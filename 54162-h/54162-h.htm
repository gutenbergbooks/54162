<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">Before</span> undertaking the present work I had no experience
as an editor. It is unnecessary for me to say,
therefore, that, were I now to undertake it, I should
pursue a somewhat different course from that which
I have pursued. The <i>New English Canaan</i> is, in many
respects, a singular book. One of its most singular features is the
extent of ground it covers. Not only is it full of obscure references
to incidents in early New England history, but it deals directly
with the aborigines, the trees, animals, fish, birds and geology of
the region; besides having constant incidental allusions to literature,&mdash;both
classic and of the author’s time,&mdash;to geography, and to then
current events. No one person can possess the knowledge necessary
to thoroughly cover so large a field. To edit properly he must have
recourse to specialists.</p>

<p>It was only as the labor of investigation increased on my hands
that I realized what a wealth of scientific and special knowledge was
to be reached, in the neighborhood of Boston, by any one engaged in
such multifarious inquiry. Were I again to enter upon it I should
confine my own labors chiefly to correspondence; for on every point
which comes up there is some one now in this vicinity, if he can only
be found out, who has made a study of it, and has more information
than the most laborious and skilful of editors can acquire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span></p>

<p>In this edition of the <i>New Canaan</i> I have not laid so many of
these specialists as I now wish, under requisition; and yet the list is
a tolerably extensive one. In every case, also, the assistance asked for
has been rendered as of course, in the true scientific spirit. My correspondence
has included Messrs. Deane, Winsor and Ellis on events
in early New England history; Professor Whitney on geographical
allusions; Professors Lane and Greenough, Dr. Everett and Mr. T.
W. Higginson, on references to the Greek and Latin classics, or quotations
from them; and the Rev. Mr. Norton on Scriptural allusions.
Mr. J. C. Gray has hunted up for me legal precedents five centuries
old, and Mr. Lindsay Swift has explained archaic expressions, to the
meaning of which I could get no clew. On the subject of trees and
herbs I called on Professors Gray and Sargent; in regard to birds,
Mr. William Brewster was indefatigable; Mr. Allen, though in very
poor health, took the chapter on animals; Professor Shaler disposed
of the geology; Messrs. Agassiz and Lyman instructed me as to fish,
and Professor Putnam as to shell-heaps. I met some allusions to
early French and other explorers, and naturally had recourse to
Messrs. Parkman and Slafter; while in regard to Indian words and
names, I have been in constant correspondence with the one authority,
Mr. J. Hammond Trumbull, who has recognized to the fullest
extent the public obligation which a mastery of a special subject
imposes on him who masters it.</p>

<p>In closing a pleasant editorial task, my chief regret, therefore, is
that the notes in this volume contain so much matter of my own.
They should have been even more eclectic than they are, and each
from the highest possible authority on the subject to which it
relates.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">MORTON OF MERRY-MOUNT.</h2>

</div>


<p>In the second book of his history of Plymouth
Plantation, Governor Bradford, while dealing
with the events of the year 1628 though writing
at a still later period, <span class="lock">says:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Aboute some three or four years before this time, ther came over one
Captaine Wolastone (a man of pretie parts), and with him three or four more
of some eminencie, who brought with them a great many servants, with provisions
and other implaments for to begine a plantation; and pitched themselves
in a place within the Massachusets, which they called, after their
Captains name, Mount-Wollaston. Amongst whom was one Mr. Morton,
who, it should seeme, had some small adventure (of his owne or other mens)
amongst them.”<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p></div>

<p>There is no other known record of Wollaston than that
contained in this passage of Bradford.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> His given name<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
even is not mentioned. It may be surmised with tolerable
certainty that he was one of the numerous traders, generally
from Bristol or the West of England, who frequented the
fishing grounds and the adjacent American coast during the
early years of the seventeenth century. Nothing is actually
known of him, however, until in 1625 he appeared in Massachusetts
Bay, as Boston Harbor was then called, at the head
of the expedition which Bradford mentions.</p>

<p>His purpose and that of his companions was to establish
a plantation and trading-post in the country of the Massachusetts
tribe of Indians. It was the third attempt of the
kind which had been made since the settlement at Plymouth,
a little more than four years before. The first of these
attempts had been that of Thomas Weston at Wessagusset,
or Weymouth, in the summer of 1622. This had resulted
in a complete failure, the story of which is told by Bradford
and Winslow, and forms one of the more striking pages in
the annals of early New England. The second attempt,
and that which next preceded Wollaston’s, had closely followed
the first, being made in the summer of 1623, under
the immediate direction of the Council for New England.
At the head of it was Captain Robert Gorges, a younger
son of Sir Ferdinando Gorges. Weston’s expedition was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
mere trading venture, having little connection with anything
which went before or which came after. That of Gorges,
however, was something more. As will presently be seen,
it had a distinct political and religious significance.</p>

<p>Robert Gorges and his party arrived in Boston Bay in
1623, during what is now the latter part of September.
They established themselves in the buildings which had
been occupied by Weston’s people during the previous winter,
and which had been deserted by them a few days less
than six months before. The site of those buildings cannot
be definitely fixed. It is supposed to have been on Phillips
Creek, a small tidal inlet of the Weymouth fore-river, a short
distance above the Quincy-Point bridge. The grant made
to Robert Gorges by the Council for New England, and
upon which he probably intended to place his party, was on
the other side of the bay, covering ten miles of sea-front and
stretching thirty miles into the interior. It was subsequently
pronounced void by the lawyers on the ground of
being “loose and uncertain,” but as nearly as can now be
fixed it covered the shore between Nahant and the mouth
of the Charles, and the region back of that as far west as
Concord and Sudbury, including Lynn and the most thickly
inhabited portions of the present county of Middlesex.</p>

<p>Reaching New England, however, late in the season,
Gorges’s first anxiety was to secure shelter for his party
against the impending winter, for the frosts had already
begun. Fortunately the few savages thereabouts had been
warned by Governor Bradford not to injure the Wessagusset
buildings, and thus they afforded a welcome shelter
to the newcomers. These were people of a very different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
class from those who had preceded them. Among them
were men of education, and some of them were married
and had brought their wives. Their settlement proved a
permanent one. Robert Gorges, it is true, the next spring
returned to England disgusted and discouraged, taking back
with him a portion of his followers. Others of them
went on to Virginia in search of a milder climate and a
more fertile soil. A few, however, remained at Wessagusset,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
and are repeatedly referred to by Morton in the
<i>New Canaan</i><a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> as his neighbors at that place.</p>

<p>When, therefore, Wollaston sailed into the bay in the
early summer of 1625, its shores were not wholly unoccupied.
His party consisted of himself and some three or
four partners, with thirty or more servants, as they were
called, or men who had sold their time for a period of years
to an employer, and who stood in the relation to him of
apprentice to master. Rasdall, according to Bradford, was
the name of one of the partners, and Fitcher would seem to
have been that of another. Thomas Morton, the author of
the <i>New English Canaan</i>, was a third.</p>

<p>Not much more is known of Morton’s life prior to his
coming to America than of Wollaston’s. He had certainly
an education of that sort which was imparted in the schools
of the Elizabethan period, for he had a smattering knowledge
of the more familiar Latin authors at least, and was fond
of classic allusion. Governor Dudley, in his letter to the
Countess of Lincoln, says that while in England he was an
attorney in “the west countries.”<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> He further intimates that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
he had there been implicated in some foul misdemeanor, on
account of which warrants were out against him. Nathaniel
Morton in his <i>Memorial</i><a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> says that the crime thus referred
to was the killing of a partner concerned with him, Thomas
Morton, in his first New England venture. Thomas Wiggin,
however, writing in 1632 to Sir John Cooke, one of
King Charles’s secretaries for foreign affairs and a member
of the Privy Council, states, upon the authority of Morton’s
“wife’s sonne and others,” that he had fled to New England
“upon a foule suspition of murther.”<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> While, therefore, it
would seem that grave charges were in general circulation
against Morton, connecting him with some deed of violence,
it is necessary to bear in mind that considerable allowance
must be made before any accusation against him can be accepted
on the word of either the Massachusetts or the Plymouth
authorities, or those in sympathy with them. Yet
Morton was a reckless man, and he lived in a time when
no great degree of sanctity attached to human life; so that
in itself there is nothing very improbable in this charge.
It is possible that before coming to America he may have
put some one out of the way. Nevertheless, as will presently
be seen, though he was subsequently arrested and in
jail in England, the accusation never took any formal shape.
That he was at some time married would appear from the
letter of Wiggin already referred to, and the allusions in the
<i>New Canaan</i> show that he had been a man passionately fond
of field sports, and a good deal of a traveller as well. He
speaks, for instance, of having been “bred in so genious a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
way” that in England he had the common use of hawks in
fowling; and, in another place, he alludes to his having been
so near the equator that “I have had the sun for my zenith.”<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
On the titlepage of his book he describes himself as “of
Cliffords Inne gent.,” which of course he would not have ventured
to do had he not really been what he there claimed to
be; for at the time the <i>New Canaan</i> was published he was
living in London and apparently one of the attorneys of the
Council for New England.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Bradford, speaking from memory,
fell into an error, therefore, when he described him as
a “kind of petie-fogger of Furnefells Inne.”<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> That in
1625 he was a man of some means is evident from the fact
that he owned an interest in the Wollaston venture; though
here again Bradford takes pains to say that the share he
represented (“of his owne or other mens”) was small, and
that he himself had so little respect amongst the rest that he
was slighted by even the meanest servants.</p>

<p>In all probability this was not Morton’s first visit to Massachusetts
Bay. Indeed, he was comparatively familiar with it,
having already passed one season on its shores. His own statement,
at the beginning of the first chapter of the second book
of the <i>Canaan</i>, seems to be conclusive on this point. He there
says: “In the month of June, Anno Salutis 1622, it was my
chance to arrive in the parts of New England with thirty servants,
and provision of all sorts fit for a plantation; and, while
our houses were building, I did endeavor to take a survey of
the country.”<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> There was but one ship which arrived in New<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
England in June, 1622, and that was the <i>Charity</i>;<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> and the
<i>Charity</i> brought out Weston’s party, which settled at Wessagusset,
answering in every respect to Morton’s description
of the party he came with. Andrew Weston, a younger
brother of the chief promoter of the enterprise, had then
come in charge of it, and is described as having been “a
heady yong man and violente.”<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> After leaving Weston’s
company at Plymouth, the <i>Charity</i> went on to Virginia,
but returned from there early in October, going it would
seem directly to Boston Bay and Wessagusset.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> One part
of the colonists had then been there three months, and
it was during those three months that Morton apparently
took the survey of the country to which he refers. As the
Wessagusset plantation was now left under the charge of
Richard Greene, it would seem that young Weston went back
to England in the <i>Charity</i>, and the inference is that Morton,
who had come out as his companion, went back with him.</p>

<p>In any event, the impression produced on Morton by this
first visit to New England was a strong and favorable one. It
looked to him a land of plenty, a veritable New Canaan.
Accordingly, he gave vent to his enthusiasm in the warm
language of the first chapter of his second book.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> With
the subsequent fate of Weston’s party he seems to have had
no connection. He must at the time have heard of it, and
was doubtless aware of the evil reputation that company left
behind. This would perfectly account for the fact that he
never mentions his having himself had anything to do with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
it. Yet it may be surmised that he returned to England
possessed with the idea of connecting himself with some
enterprise, either Weston’s or another, organized to make a
settlement on the shores of Boston Bay and there to open
a trade in furs. He had then had no experience of a New
England winter; though, for that matter, when he afterwards
had repeated experiences of it, they in no way changed
his views of the country. To the last, apparently, he thought
of it as he first saw it during the summer and early autumn
of 1622, when it was a green fresh wilderness, nearly devoid
of inhabitants and literally alive with game.</p>

<p>News of the utter failure of Weston’s enterprise must have
reached London in the early summer of 1623. Whether
Morton was in any way personally affected thereby does not
appear, though from his allusions to Weston’s treatment
by Robert Gorges at Plymouth, during the winter of 1623-4,
it is not at all improbable that he was.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> During the following
year (1624) he is not heard of; but early in 1625 he had
evidently succeeded in effecting some sort of a combination
which resulted in the Wollaston expedition.</p>

<p>The partners in this enterprise would seem to have been
the merest adventurers. So far as can be ascertained, they
did not even trouble themselves to take out a patent for the
land on which they proposed to settle,<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> in this respect showing
themselves even more careless than Weston.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> With the
exception of Morton, they apparently had no practical
knowledge of the country, and their design clearly was to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
establish themselves wherever they might think good, and
to trade in such way as they saw fit.</p>

<p>When the party reached its destination in Massachusetts
Bay, they found Wessagusset still occupied by such as were
left of Robert Gorges’s company, who had then been there
nearly two years. They had necessarily, therefore, to establish
themselves elsewhere. A couple of miles or so north of Wessagusset,
on the other side of the Monatoquit, and within the
limits of what is now the town of Quincy, was a place called
by the Indians Passonagessit. The two localities were separated
from each other not only by the river, which here
widens out into a tidal estuary, but by a broad basin which
filled and emptied with every tide, while around it were
extensive salt marshes intersected by many creeks. The upland,
too, was interspersed with tangled swamps lying between
gravel ridges. At Passonagessit the new-comers established
themselves, and the place is still known as Mount
Wollaston.</p>

<p>In almost all respects Passonagessit was for their purpose
a better locality than Wessagusset. They had come there
to trade. However it may have been with the others, in
Morton’s calculations at least the plantation must have been
a mere incident to the more profitable dealing in peltry.
A prominent position on the shore, in plain view of the
entrance to the bay, would be with him an important consideration.
This was found at Passonagessit. It was a spacious
upland rising gently from the beach and, a quarter of
a mile or so from it, swelling into a low hill.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> It was not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
connected with the interior by any navigable stream, but
Indians coming from thence would easily find their way to
it; and, while a portion of the company could always be
there ready to trade, others of them might make excursions
to all points on the neighboring coast where furs were to be
had. Looking seaward, on the left of the hill was a considerable
tidal creek; in front of it, across a clear expanse of
water a couple of miles or so in width, lay the islands of the
harbor in apparently connected succession. Though the anchoring
grounds among these islands afforded perfect places<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
of refuge for vessels, Passonagessit itself, as the settlers there
must soon have realized, labored, as a trading-point, under
one serious disadvantage. There was no deep water near
it. Except when the tide was at least half full, the shore
could be approached only in boats. On the other hand, so
far as planting was concerned, the conditions were favorable.
The soil, though light, was very good; and the spot, lying
as it did close to “the Massachusetts fields,” had some years
before been cleared of trees by the Sachem Chickatawbut,
who had made his home there.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> He had, however, abandoned
it at the time when the great pestilence swept away
his tribe, and tradition still points out a small savin-covered
hummock, near Squantum, on the south side of the Neponset,
as his subsequent dwelling-place. Morton says that
Chickatawbut’s mother was buried at Passonagessit, and
that the Plymouth people, on one of their visits, incurred his
enmity by despoiling her grave of its bear skins.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> So far as
the natives were concerned, however, any settlers on the
shores of Boston Bay, after the year 1623, had little cause
for disquietude. They were a thoroughly crushed and broken-spirited
race. The pestilence had left only a few hundred
of the whole Massachusetts tribe, and in 1631 Chickatawbut
had but some fifty or sixty followers.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> It was a dying
race; and what little courage the pestilence had left them
was effectually and forever crushed out by Miles Standish,
when at Wessagusset, in April, 1623, he put to death seven
of the strongest and boldest of their few remaining men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p>Having selected a site, Wollaston and his party built their
house nearly in the centre of the summit of the hill, on
a gentle westerly slope. It commanded towards the north
and east an unbroken view of the bay and all the entrances
to it; while on the opposite or landward side, some four or
five miles away, rose the heavily-wooded Blue Hills. Across
the bay to the north lay Shawmut, beyond the intervening
peninsulas of Squantum and Mattapan. Wessagusset was to
the south, across the marshes and creeks, and hidden from
view by forest and uplands.</p>

</div>

<p>During their first season, the summer of 1625, Wollaston’s
party must have been fully occupied in the work of building
their houses and laying out their plantation. The winter
followed. A single experience of a winter on that shore
seems to have sufficed for Captain Wollaston, as it had
before sufficed for Captain Gorges. He apparently came to
the conclusion that there was little profit and no satisfaction
for him in that region. Accordingly, during the early months
of 1626, he determined to go elsewhere. The only account of
what now ensued is that contained in Bradford; for Morton
nowhere makes a single allusion to Wollaston or any of his
associates, nor does he give any account of the origin, composition
or purposes of the Wollaston enterprise. His silence
on all these points is, indeed, one of the singular features
in the <i>New Canaan</i>. Such references as he does make are
always to Weston and Weston’s attempt;<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> and he seems to
take pains to confound that attempt with Wollaston’s. Once
only he mentions the number of the party with which he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
landed,<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> and the fact that it was subsequently dissolved;<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> but
how it came to be dissolved he does not explain. The inference
from this is unavoidable. Morton was free enough
in talking of what he did and saw at Passonagessit, of his
revels there, of how he was arrested, and persecuted out of
the country. That he says not a word of Wollaston or his
other partners must be due to the fact that the subject was
one about which he did not care to commit himself. Nevertheless
Bradford could not but have known the facts, for not
only at a later day was Morton himself for long periods of
time at Plymouth, but when the events of which he speaks
occurred Bradford must have been informed of them by the
Wessagusset people, as well as by Fitcher. As we only
know what Bradford tells us, it can best be given in his own
<span class="lock">words:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Having continued there some time, and not finding things to answer their
expectations, nor profit to arise as they looked for, Captain Wollaston takes a
great part of the servants and transports them to Virginia, where he puts them
off at good rates, selling their time to other men; and writes back to one Mr.
Rasdall, one of his chief partners and accounted their merchant, to bring another
part of them to Virginia likewise; intending to put them off there, as he
had done the rest. And he, with the consent of the said Rasdall, appointed
one Fitcher to be his Lieutenant, and govern the remains of the plantation till
he, or Rasdall, returned to take further order thereabout. But this Morton,
abovesaid, having more craft than honesty, in the others’ absence watches an
opportunity, (commons being but hard amongst them,) and got some strong
drink and other junkets, and made them a feast; and after they were merry,
he began to tell them he would give them good counsel. ‘You see,’ saith he,
‘that many of your fellows are carried to Virginia; and if you stay till this
Rasdall returns, you will also be carried away and sold for slaves with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
rest. Therefore, I would advise you to thrust out this Lieutenant Fitcher;
and I, having a part in the plantation, will receive you as my partners and
consociates. So may you be free from service; and we will converse, trade,
plant and live together as equals, and support and protect one another:’ or
to like effect. This counsel was easily received, so they took opportunity
and thrust Lieutenant Fitcher out a-doors, and would suffer him to come no
more amongst them; but forced him to seek bread to eat, and other relief,
from his neighbors, till he could get passage for England.”<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p></div>

<p>Wollaston’s process of depletion to Virginia had reduced
the number of servants at Passonagessit from thirty or thirty-five,
as Morton variously states it,<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> to six at most.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> It was as
the head of these that Morton established himself in control
at Merry-Mount, as he called the place,<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> sometime, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
would seem, in the summer of 1626. He had now two distinct
objects in view: one was enjoyment, the other was
profit; and apparently he was quite reckless as to the methods
he pursued in securing either the one or the other. If
he was troubled by his former partners appearing to assert
their rights, as he probably was, no mention is made of it.
There were no courts to appeal to in America, and those of
Europe were far away; nor would it have been easy or
inexpensive to enforce their process in New England. Accordingly
nothing more is heard of Wollaston or Rasdall,
though Bradford does say that Morton was “vehemently
suspected for the murder of a man that had adventured
moneys with him when he first came.”<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> There is a vague
tradition, referred to John Adams, that Wollaston was subsequently
lost at sea;<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> but as a full century must have
elapsed between the occurrence of the event and the birth of
John Adams, this tradition is quite as unreliable as traditions
usually are.</p>

<p>Passionately fond of field sports, Morton found ample opportunity
for the indulgence of his tastes in New England.
He loved to ramble through the woods with his dog and
gun, or sail in his boat on the bay. The Indians, too, were his
allies, and naturally enough; for not only did he offer them
an open and easy-going market for their furs, but he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
companionable with them. They shared in his revels. He
denies that he was in the habit of selling them spirits,<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> but
where spirits were as freely used as Morton’s account shows
they were at Merry-Mount, the Indians undoubtedly had
their share. Nor were his relations confined to the Indian
men. The period of Elizabeth and James I. was one of
probably as much sexual incontinency as any in English
history. Some of the earlier writers on the New England
Indians have spoken of the modesty of the women,&mdash;Wood,
in his <i>Prospect</i>, for instance, and Josselyn, in the
second of his <i>Two Voyages</i>.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> Morton, however, is signifi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>cantly
silent on this point, and the idea of female chastity in
the Indian mind, in the rare cases where it existed at all,
seems to have been of the vaguest possible description.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>
Morton was not a man likely to be fastidious, and his reference
to the “lasses in beaver coats”<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> is suggestive. Merry-Mount
was unquestionably, so far as temperance and morality
were concerned, by no means a commendable place.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p>Morton’s inclination to boisterous revelry culminated at
last in that proceeding which scandalized the Plymouth elders
and has passed into history. In the spring of 1627 he
erected the May-pole of Merry-Mount. To erect these poles
seems at that time to have been a regular English observance,
which even the fishermen on the coast did not neglect.
When, for instance, the forerunners of Weston’s colony at
Wessagusset reached the Damariscove Islands, in the spring
of 1622, the first thing they saw was a May-pole, which the
men belonging to the ships there had newly set up, “and
weare very mery.”<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> There is no room for question that in
England, during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
May-day festivities were associated with a great deal of
license. They were so associated in the minds of Governor
Bradford and his fellows. Christmas was at least a Christian
festivity. Not so May-day. That was distinctly Pagan
in its origin. It represented all there was left of the Saturnalia
and the worship of the Roman courtesan. May-day
and May-day festivities, accordingly, were things to be altogether
reformed. They were by no means the innocent,
grateful welcoming of spring which modern admirers of the
so-called good old times&mdash;which, in point of fact, were very
gross and brutal times&mdash;are wont to picture to themselves.
“I have heard it credibly reported,” wrote Stubbes in his
<i>Anatomy of Abuses</i>, “(and that <i>viva voce</i>) by men of great
gravitie, credite and reputation, that of fourtie, three score, or
a hundred maides goyng to the woode over night [a-Maying],
there have scarcely the thirde parte of them returned home
againe undefiled.”<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> All this it is necessary to now bear in
mind, lest what Bradford wrote down in his history of Morton’s
doings should seem grotesque. He was speaking of
what represented in his memory a period of uncleanness, a
sort of carnival of the sexes.</p>

<p>Morton’s own account of the festivities at Merry-Mount
on the May-day of 1627, which came on what would now be
the 11th of the month, will be found in the fourteenth chapter
of the third book of the <i>Canaan</i>.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> It does not need to
be repeated here. Bradford’s account was very different:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“They allso set up a May-pole, drinking and dancing aboute it many days
togeather, inviting the Indean women, for their consorts, dancing and frisking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
togither, (like so many fairies, or furies rather,) and worse practises. As if
they had anew revived and celebrated the feasts of the Roman Goddes Flora,
or the beasly practieses of the madd Bacchinalians. Morton likwise (to shew
his poetrie,) composed sundry rimes and verses, some tending to lasciviousnes,
and others to the detraction and scandall of some persons, which he affixed to
this idle or idoll May-polle.”<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p></div>

<p>Morton’s verses can be found in their proper place in
the <i>New Canaan</i>, but the principal charge now to be made
against them is their incomprehensibility. Judged even by
the standard of the present day, much more by that of the
day when they were written, they are not open to criticism
because of their “lasciviousnes.” They are decent enough,
though very bad and very dull. As to the “detraction and
scandall of some persons,” alleged against them,&mdash;if indeed
they contained anything of the sort,&mdash;it was so very carefully
concealed that no one could easily have understood
it then, and Morton’s own efforts at explanation fail to make
it intelligible now.</p>

<p>The festivities around the May-pole were, however, but
Morton’s amusements. Had he confined himself to these he
might, so far as the people at Plymouth at least were concerned,
to the end of his life have lived on the shores of Boston
Bay, and erected a new pole with each recurring spring.
The only resistance he would have had to overcome would
have been a remonstrance now and then, hardly less comical
than it was earnest. The business methods he pursued were
a more serious matter. He had come to New England to
make money, as well as to enjoy the license of a frontier
life. He was fully alive to the profits of the peltry trade,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
and in carrying on that trade he was restrained by no
scruples. The furs of course came from the interior,
brought by Indians. In his dealings with the Indians
Morton adopted a policy natural enough for one of his
reckless nature, but which imperilled the existence of every
European on the coast. The two things the savages most
coveted were spirits and guns,&mdash;fire-water and fire-arms.
Beads and knives and hatchets and colored cloth served very
well to truck with at first. But these very soon lost their
attraction. Guns and rum never did. For these the Indians
would at any time give whatever they possessed. The trade
in fire-arms had already attained some proportions when, in
1622, it was strictly forbidden by a proclamation of King
James, issued at the instance of the Council for New England.
The companion trade in spirits, less dangerous to the whites
but more destructive to the savages, was looked upon as
scandalous, but it was not prohibited. Morton cared equally
little for either law or morals. He had come to New England
for furs, and he meant to get them.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Hearing what gain the French and fishermen made by trading of pieces,
powder and shot to the Indians, he, as the head of this consortship, began
the practice of the same in these parts. And first he taught them how to use
them, to charge and discharge, and what proportion of powder to give the
piece, according to the size and bigness of the same; and what shot to use
for fowl and what for deer. And having thus instructed them, he employed
some of them to hunt and fowl for him, so as they became far more active in
that employment than any of the English, by reason of their swiftness of foot
and nimbleness of body; being also quick sighted, and by continual exercise
well knowing the haunts of all sorts of game. So as when they saw the execution
that a piece would do, and the benefit that might come by the same,
they became mad, as it were, after them, and would not stick to give any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
price they could attain to for them; accounting their bows and arrows but
bawbles in comparison of them.”<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p></div>

<p>This was Bradford’s story, nor does Morton deny it. That
he would have denied it if he could is apparent. The practices
complained of were forbidden by a royal proclamation,
issued at the instance of Sir Ferdinando Gorges. In his
speech in defence of the great patent, before the House of
Commons in Committee of the Whole, in 1621, Gorges had
emphatically dwelt on the sale of arms and ammunition to
the savages as an abuse then practised, which threatened the
extinction of the New England settlements.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> Fifteen years
later, when he wrote the <i>New Canaan</i>, Morton was a dependent
of Gorges. The fact that he had dealt in fire-arms,
in contemptuous defiance of the proclamation, was openly
charged against him. He did deny that he had sold the
savages spirits. These, he said, were the life of trade; the
Indians would “pawn their wits” for them, but these he
would never let them have. In the matter of fire-arms, however,
he preserved a discreet and significant silence. He
made no more allusion to them than he did to Wollaston or
his partners at Merry-Mount.</p>

<p>In the whole record of the early Plymouth settlement,
from the first skirmish with the Cape Cod savages, in December,
1620, to the Wessagusset killing, there is no mention of
a gun being seen in an Indian’s hands. On the contrary,
the savages stood in mortal terror of fire-arms. But now at
last it seemed as if Morton was about not only to put guns
in their hands, but to instruct them in their use.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“This Morton,” says Bradford, “having thus taught them the use of pieces,
he sold them all he could spare; and he and his consorts determined to send
for many out of England, and had by some of the ships sent for above a score.
The which being known, and his neighbors meeting the Indians in the woods
armed with guns in this sort, it was a terror unto them, who lived straglingly,
and were of no strength in any place. And other places (though more remote)
saw this mischief would quickly spread over all, if not prevented.
Besides, they saw they should keep no servants, for Morton would entertain
any, how vile soever, and all the scum of the country, or any discontents,
would flock to him from all places, if this nest was not broken; and they
should stand in more fear of their lives and goods (in short time) from this
wicked and debauched crew than from the savages themselves.”<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p></div>

<p>Thus, in the only branches of trade the country then
afforded, Morton was not only pressing all the other settlers
hard, but he was pressing them in an unfair way. If the
savages could exchange their furs for guns, they would not
exchange them for anything else. Those not prepared to
give guns might withdraw from the market. The business,
too, conducted in this way, was a most profitable one. Morton
says that in the course of five years one of his servants
was thought to have accumulated, in the trade in beaver
skins, no less than a thousand pounds;<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> and a thousand
pounds in 1635 was more than the equivalent of ten thousand
now. This statement was undoubtedly an exaggeration;
yet it is evident that at even ten shillings a pound in
England, which Morton gives as the current price, though
Bradford says he never knew it less than fourteen, beaver
skins, which cost little or nothing in America, yielded a large
profit. As Morton expressed it, his plantation “beganne to
come forward.”<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> When, in 1625, the Plymouth people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
found their way up into Maine,<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> and first opened a trade
with the savages there, Morton was not slow in following
them. In 1628 they established a permanent station on the
Kennebec,<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> yet apparently as early at least as 1627, if not in
1626, Morton had forestalled them there, and hindered them
of a season’s furs.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<p>The injury done to the other settlers in a trading point of
view, however, serious as it unquestionably was, became insignificant
in comparison with the consequences which must
result to them from the presence on the coast of such a resort
as Merry-Mount. The region was vast, and in it there was
no pretence of any government. It was the yearly rendezvous
of a rough and lawless class of men, only one step removed
from freebooters, who cared for nothing except immediate
gain. Once let such a gathering-place as that of which
Morton was now head become fixed and known, and soon it
would develop into a nest of pirates. Of this there could be
no doubt; the Plymouth people had good cause for the
alarm which Bradford expressed. It mattered not whether
Morton realized the consequences of what he was doing, or
failed to realize them; the result would be the same.</p>

<p>It gradually, therefore, became apparent to all those dwelling
along the coast, from the borders of Maine to Cape Cod,
that either the growing nuisance at Merry-Mount must be
abated, or they would have to leave the country. The course
to be pursued in regard to it was, however, not equally clear.
The number of the settlements along the coast had considerably
increased since Wollaston’s arrival.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> The Hiltons and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
David Thomson had established themselves at Dover Neck
and Piscataqua as early as 1623; and sometime in 1625
apparently, Thomson, bringing with him his young wife and
a servant or two, had moved down into Boston Bay, and
established himself, only a mile or two away from Mount
Wollaston, on the island which still bears his name. He
had died a little while after, and in 1628 his widow was
living there alone, with one child and some servants. In
1625 or 1626 the Wessagusset settlement had divided.
Those of Gorges’s following who remained there had never
been wholly satisfied. It was no place for trade. Accordingly
Blackstone, Maverick and Walford, the two last being
married and taking their wives with them, had moved across
the bay, and established themselves respectively at Shawmut
or Boston, at Noddle’s Island or East Boston, and at Mishawum
or Charlestown. Jeffreys, Bursley and some others had
remained at Wessagusset, and were Morton’s neighbors at
that place, whom he says he was in the custom of visiting
from time to time, “to have the benefit of company.”<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> At
Hull, already known by that name,<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> there were the Grays and
a few other settlers. These had been joined by Lyford and
Oldham and their friends, when the latter were expelled from
Plymouth in the spring of 1625; but the next year, finding
the place probably an uninviting one, Lyford had crossed
over to Cape Ann, and thence a year later passed on to
Virginia. Oldham still remained at Nantasket.</p>

<p>Such were those neighbors of Morton, the chiefs of the
straggling plantations, referred to by Bradford as being of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
“no strength in any place.” Together they may possibly
have numbered from fifty to an hundred souls. The Plymouth
settlement was, comparatively speaking, organized and
numerous, consisting as it did of some two hundred persons,
dwelling in about forty houses, which were protected by a
stockade of nearly half a mile in length. Nevertheless even
there, by the summer of 1627, the alarm at the increase of
fire-arms in the hands of the savages began to be very great.
They had spread “both north and south all the land over,”<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>
and it was computed that the savages now possessed at least
sixty pieces. One trader alone, it was reported, had sold
them a score of guns and an hundred weight of ammunition.
Bradford thus takes up the <span class="lock">story:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“So sundry of the chiefs of the straggling plantations, meeting together,
agreed by mutual consent, to solicit those of Plymouth, (who were then of
more strength than them all,) to join with them to prevent the further growth
of this mischief, and suppress Morton and his consorts before they grew to
further head and strength. Those that joined in this action, (and after contributed
to the charge of sending him to England,) were from Piscataqua,
Naumkeag, Winnisimmet, Wessagusset, Nantasket, and other places where any
English were seated. Those of Plymouth being thus sought to by their messengers
and letters, and weighing both their reasons and the common danger,
were willing to afford them their help, though themselves had least cause of
fear or hurt. So, to be short, they first resolved jointly to write to him, and,
in a friendly and neighborly way, to admonish him to forbear these courses;
and sent a messenger with their letters to bring his answer. But he was so
high as he scorned all advice, and asked&mdash;Who had to do with him?&mdash;he had
and would trade pieces with the Indians in despite of all: with many other
scurrilous terms full of disdain.</p>

<p>“They sent to him a second time, and bade him be better advised, and
more temperate in his terms, for the country could not bear the injury he did;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
it was against their common safety, and against the King’s proclamation. He
answered in high terms, as before; and that the King’s proclamation was no
law: demanding, what penalty was upon it? It was answered, more than he
could bear, his Majesty’s displeasure. But insolently he persisted, and said
the King was dead, and his displeasure with him; and many the like things;
and threatened, withal, that if any came to molest him, let them look to themselves;
for he would prepare for them.”<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p></div>

<p>However it may have been with the position he took as a
matter of public policy, Morton at least showed himself in
this dispute better versed in the law of England than those
who admonished him. On the first of the two points made
by him he was clearly right. King James’s proclamation was
not law. This had been definitely decided more than fifteen
years before, when in 1610, in a case referred to all the
judges, Lord Coke, in reporting their decision, had stated
on his own authority that “the King cannot create any
offence, by his prohibition or proclamation, which was not
an offence before, for that was to change the law, and to
make an offence, which was not; for <i>ubi non est lex, ibi non
est transgressio</i>; <i>ergo</i>, that which cannot be punished without
proclamation cannot be punished with it.”<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<p>In regard to the second point made by Morton, that the
King’s proclamation died with him, the same distinction
between statutes and proclamations, that the former were of
perpetual obligation until repealed and that the latter lost
their force on the demise of the crown,&mdash;this distinction was,
a century and a half later, stated by Hume<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> to have existed
in James’s time. Lord Chief Justice Campbell has, how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>ever,
exclaimed against the statement as a display of ignorant
“audacity,” and declares that he was unable to find
in the authorities a trace of any such doctrine.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> On this
point, therefore, the law of Thomas Morton was probably as
bad as that of David Hume. Nevertheless the passage in
Bradford affords a curious bit of evidence that some such
distinction as that drawn by Hume, though it may not have
got into the books, did exist in both the legal and the public
mind of the first half of the seventeenth century.</p>

<p>Whether Morton’s law on the subject of proclamations
was or was not found mattered little however. It was not
then to be debated, as the question with the settlers was one
of self-preservation. The Plymouth magistrates had gone
too far to stop. If they even hesitated, now, there was an
end to all order in New England. Morton would not be
slow to realize that he had faced them down, and his insolence
would in future know no bounds.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“So they mutually resolved to proceed, and obtained of the Governor of
Plymouth to send Captain Standish, and some other aid with him, to take
Morton by force. The which accordingly was done; but they found him to
stand stiffly in his defence, having made fast his doors, armed his consorts,
set divers dishes of powder and bullets ready on the table; and, if they had
not been over armed with drink, more hurt might have been done. They
summoned him to yield, but he kept his house, and they could get nothing
but scoffs and scorns from him; but at length, fearing they would do some
violence to the house, he and some of his crew came out, but not to yield,
but to shoot. But they were so steeled with drink as their pieces were too
heavy for them; himself, with a carbine (overcharged and almost half filled
with powder and shot, as was after found) had thought to have shot Captain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
Standish; but he stept to him, and put by his piece and took him. Neither
was there any hurt done to any of either side, save that one was so drunk that
he ran his own nose upon the point of a sword that one held before him as
he entered the house; but he lost but a little of his hot blood.”<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p></div>

<p>Morton’s own account of “this outragious riot,” as he
calls it, is contained in the fifteenth chapter of the third
book of the <i>New Canaan</i>.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> It differs considerably from
Bradford’s, but not in essentials. He says that the occurrence
took place in June; and as Bradford’s letters of explanation,
sent with the prisoner to England, are dated the 9th
of June,<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> it must have been quite early in the month. He
further says that he was captured in the first place at Wessagusset,
“where by accident they found him;” but escaping
thence during the night, through the carelessness of those
set on guard over him, he made his way in the midst of a
heavy thunder-storm to Mount Wollaston, going up the
Monatoquit until he could cross it. The whole distance from
point to point was, for a person familiar with the country,
perhaps eight miles. Getting home early the next morning
he made his preparations for resistance in the way described
by Bradford. Of the whole party at Merry-Mount
more than half, four apparently, were then absent in the
interior getting furs. This fact, indeed, was probably well
known to his neighbors, who had planned the arrest accordingly.
Standish, having eight men with him, followed
Morton round to Mount Wollaston, probably by water, the
morning succeeding his escape; and what ensued seems to
have been sufficiently well described by Bradford. One at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
least of the Merry-Mount garrison got extremely tipsy before
the attacking party appeared, and Morton, seeing that resistance
was hopeless, surrendered, after in vain trying to make
some terms for himself.</p>

<p>Having been arrested he was at once carried to Plymouth,
and a council was held there to decide upon the disposition
to be made of him. According to his own account certain
of the magistrates, among whom he specially names Standish,
advocated putting him to death at once, and so ending
the matter. They were not in favor of sending him to
England. Such a course as this was, however, wholly out
of keeping with the character of the Plymouth colony, and
it is tolerably safe to say that it was never really proposed.
Morton imagined it; but he also circumstantially asserts that
when milder councils prevailed, and it was decided to send
him to England, Standish was so enraged that he threatened
to shoot him with his own hand, as he was put into the
boat.<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<p>Either because they did not care to keep him at Plymouth
until he could be sent away, or because an outward-bound
fishing-vessel was more likely at that season to be
found at the fishing-stations, Morton was almost immediately
sent to the Isles of Shoals. He remained there a month;
and of his experiences during that time he gives a wholly
unintelligible account in the <i>New Canaan</i>.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> At last a chance
offered of sending him out in a fishing-vessel bound to
old Plymouth, England. He went under charge of John
Oldham, who was chosen to represent the associated planters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
in this matter, and who carried two letters, in the nature of
credentials, prepared by Governor Bradford, the one addressed
to the Council for New England and the other to
Sir Ferdinando Gorges personally.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> In these letters Bradford
set forth in detail the nature of the offences charged
against Morton, and asked that he might be brought “to his
answer before those whom it may concern.” These letters
were signed by the chiefs of the several plantations, at whose
common charge the expenses of Oldham’s mission, as well
as Standish’s arrest, were defrayed, and towards this charge
they contributed as follows, though Bradford says the total
cost was much <span class="lock">more:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Oldham and Morton reached Plymouth during the later
summer or early autumn of 1628. They must, therefore,
have passed the outward-bound expedition of Endicott, the
forerunners of the great Puritan migration of 1630-7, in
mid-ocean, as on the 6th of September the latter reached
Naumkeag. The grant of the Massachusetts Company, which
Endicott represented, had been regularly obtained from the
Council for New England, and bore date the 19th of March,
1628. It covered the sea-front within the space of three
English miles to the northward of the Merrimack and to
the southward of the Charles, “or of any and every part of
either of these streams;” while it extended “from the Atlantick
and Western Sea and Ocean on the East Parte, to
the South Sea on the West Parte.” It also included everything
lying within the space of three miles to the southward
of the southernmost part of Massachusetts, by which was
meant Boston Bay.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> It was clear, therefore, that Mount
Wollaston was included in this grant.</p>

<p>Morton’s establishment was thus brought within Endicott’s
government. Its existence and character must already have
been well known in England, and it is not at all improbable
that its suppression had been there decided upon. Whether
this was so or not, however, Endicott certainly learned, as
soon as he landed at Naumkeag, of the action which had
been taken three months before. It commended itself to
him; though he doubtless regretted that more condign pun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>ishment
had not been administered to Morton and his crew
on the spot, and did not delay to take such steps as were
still in his power, to make good what in this respect had
been lacking. As Bradford says, “visiting those parts [he]
caused that May-polle to be cutt downe, and rebuked them
for their profannes, and admonished them to looke ther
should be better walking; so they now, or others, changed
the name of their place againe, and called it Mounte-Dagon.”<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

<p>Morton and Oldham, meanwhile, were in England. As
Oldham bore letters to Gorges and landed at Plymouth, of
which place the latter then was and for many years had
been the royal governor, there can be no doubt that Morton
was at once brought before him. As respects New England
Gorges’s curiosity was insatiable. Any one who came
from there, whether a savage or a sea-captain, was eagerly
questioned by him; and his collection of charts, memoirs,
letters, journals and memorials, relating to the discovery of
those parts, is said to have been unequalled.<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> Oldham and
Morton had lived there for years. They knew all that was
then known about the country and its resources. They both
of them had unlimited faith in its possibilities, and talked
about an hundred per cent profit within the year, as if it
were a thing easily compassed.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> Talk of this kind Gorges
liked to hear. It suited his temperament; and it would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
seem not improbable that Morton soon found this out, and
bore himself accordingly.</p>

<p>Meanwhile it was not possible for the Council for New
England and the Massachusetts Company to long move in
harmony. The former was an association of courtiers, and
the latter one of Puritans. The Council planned to create
in the New World a score or two of great feudal domains
for English noblemen; the Company proposed to itself a
commonwealth there. Accordingly difficulties between the
two at once began to crop out. The original grant to the
Company of March 19, 1628, had been made by the Council,
with the assent of Gorges. The tract already conceded to
Robert Gorges, in 1622, was included in it; but Sir Ferdinando
insisted that the subsequent and larger grant was
made with a distinct saving of all rights vested under the
prior one.<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> This the Company was not prepared to admit;
and, as the business of the Council was habitually done in a
careless slipshod way, the record was by no means clear. A
question of title, involving some three hundred square miles
of territory in the heart of the Company’s grant, was therefore
raised at once.</p>

<p>Captain Robert Gorges meanwhile had died, and the title
to his grant had passed to his brother John. It would seem
that Oldham, who was a pushing man, had come out to England
with some scheme of his own for obtaining a patent
from the Council, and organizing a strong trading company
to operate under it. The result was that John Gorges now
deeded to him a portion of the Robert Gorges grant, being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
the whole region lying between the Charles and the Saugus
rivers, for a distance of five miles from the coast on the
former and three miles on the latter. This deed may and
probably did bear a date, January 10, 1629, similar to that
of another deed of a yet larger tract out of the same grant,
which John Gorges executed to Sir William Brereton.
The lands thus conveyed were distinctly within the limits
covered by the grant to the Massachusetts Company, and a
serious question of title was raised. The course now pursued
by the Company could not but have been singularly
offensive to Gorges. They outgeneralled him in his own
field of action. They too had friends at court. Accordingly
they went directly to the throne. A royal confirmation
of their grant from the Council was solicited and
obtained. On the 4th of March, 1629, King Charles’s charter
of the Massachusetts Company passed the seals.</p>

<p>It now became a race, for the actual possession of the disputed
territory, between the representatives of the Company
on the one side and the Gorges grantees on the other. The
former, under advice of counsel, denied the validity of the
Robert Gorges grant of 1622. It was, they claimed, void
in law, being “loose and uncertain.”<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> They instructed Endicott
to hurry a party forward to effect an actual occupation.
This he at once did; and the settlement of Charlestown,
in the summer of 1629, was the result. Meanwhile
Oldham, having in vain tried to coax or browbeat the Company
into an arrangement satisfactory to himself, was endeavoring
to fit out an expedition of his own.<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> He had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
not the means at his disposal; and, convinced of this at last,
he gave up the contest.</p>

<p>At an early stage in these proceedings he would seem
to have wholly lost sight of so much of the business he
had in hand as related to Thomas Morton. Bradford’s
expression, in referring to what took place, is that Morton
“foold” Oldham.<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> Morton himself, however, says<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> that Oldham
did the best he could, and tried to set the officers of the
law at work, but was advised that Morton had committed
no crime of which the English courts could take cognizance.
He had at most only disregarded a proclamation. All this
seems very probable. Nevertheless, for violating a proclamation,
he could at that time have been proceeded against
in the Star Chamber. It is true that in their decision in
1610, already referred to,<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> the twelve judges had said, “Lastly,
if the offence be not punishable in the Star Chamber, the
prohibition of it by proclamation cannot make it punishable
there.”<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> This, however, was the language of the bench in
the days of James, when Coke was Chief Justice. In 1629
the current of opinion was running strongly in the opposite
direction. Sir Nicholas Hyde, as Chief Justice, was then
“setting law and decency at defiance” in support of prerogative,<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>
and a few years later Sir John Finch was to announce
“that while he was Keeper no man should be so
saucy as to dispute these orders” of the Lords of the
Council.<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> Law or no law, therefore, Morton could easily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
have been held to a severe account in the Star Chamber,
had Gorges been disposed to press matters against him there.
He clearly was not so disposed. The inference, therefore, is
that Morton had succeeded in thoroughly ingratiating himself
with Gorges; and Oldham, as he was now a grantee of
Gorges’s son, did not see his account in pressing matters.
Accordingly Bradford’s letters and complaints were quietly
ignored; and his “lord of misrule,” and head of New England’s
first “schoole of Athisme,”<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> escaped without, so far as
could be discovered, even a rebuke for his misdeeds.</p>

<p>Nor was this all. Isaac Allerton was at that time in
London, as the agent of the Plymouth colony. The most
important business he had in hand was to procure a new
patent for the Plymouth people, covering by correct bounds
a grant on the Kennebec, with which region they were now
opening a promising trade. They also wanted to secure, if
possible, a royal charter for themselves like that which had
just been issued to the Massachusetts Company. In the
matter of the patent, Allerton had to deal with the Council
for New England; the granting of the charter lay at Whitehall.
Altogether it was a troublesome and vexatious business,
and the agent soon found that he could make no headway
except through favor. The influence of Gorges became
necessary. In the light of subsequent events it would seem
altogether probable that Morton now made himself useful.
At any rate, when Allerton returned to New England, in
1629, with the patent but without a charter, he astonished
and scandalized the Plymouth community by bringing Mor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>ton
back with him. They apparently landed sometime in
August,<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> and we have two accounts of Morton’s reception at
Plymouth; one his own, and the other Governor Bradford’s.
Both are characteristic. Morton says that</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Being ship’d againe for the parts of New Canaan, [he] was put in at
Plimmouth in the very faces of them, to their terrible amazement to see him
at liberty; and [they] told him hee had not yet fully answered the matter they
could object against him. Hee onely made this modest reply, that he did
perceave they were willfull people, that would never be answered: and he derided
them for their practises and losse of laboure.”<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></p></div>

<p>Bradford, looking at the transaction from the other point
of view, <span class="lock">says:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Mr. Allerton gave them great and just ofence in bringing over this year,
for base gaine, that unworthy man, and instrumente of mischeefe, Morton, who
was sent home but the year before for his misdemenors. He not only
brought him over, but to the towne, (as it were to nose them,) and lodged him
at his owne house, and for a while used him as a scribe to doe his bussines.”<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p></div>

<p>In view of Morton’s escape from all punishment in England,
and his return a little later to Mount Wollaston, Bradford
speaks of the trouble and charge of his arrest as having
been incurred “to little effect.”<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> This, however, was
not so. On the contrary, it is not often that an act of government
repression produces effects equally decisive. The
nuisance was abated and the danger dispelled; the fact that
there was a power on the coast, ready to assert itself in the
work of maintaining order, was established and had to be
recognized; and, finally, a wholly unscrupulous competitor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
was driven out of trade. These results were well worth all
that Morton’s arrest cost, and much more.</p>

<p>It does not appear how long Morton now remained at
Plymouth. It could not, however, have been more than a
few weeks before Allerton, who himself went back to England
the same season, was, as Bradford puts it, “caused to
pack him away.” He then returned to Mount Wollaston,
where he seems to have found a remnant of his old company,&mdash;apparently
the more modest of them and such as
had looked to their better walking. Hardly, however, had
he well gotten back when he was in trouble with Endicott.
The first difficulty arose out of the jealousy which existed
between the “old planters,” as they were called, and those
who belonged to the Massachusetts Company. The old
planters were the very men who had associated themselves,
eighteen months before, to bring about the suppression of
the establishment at Mount Wollaston. Now they also were
beginning to feel the pressure of authority, and they did
not like it. In their helpless anger they even spoke of themselves
as “slaves” of the new Company.<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> They could no
longer plant what they chose or trade with whom they
pleased.</p>

<p>On these points Endicott had explicit instructions. They
were contained in the letters of Cradock of April 17 and
May 28, 1629, which are to be found in Young’s <i>Chronicles
of Massachusetts</i>, and contain the policy of the company, set
forth in clear vigorous English. In pursuance of those instructions,
Endicott seems to have summoned all the old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
planters dwelling within the limits of the patent to meet in a
General Court at Salem, sometime in the latter part of 1629.
There he doubtless advised them as to the policy which the
Company intended to pursue; and Morton says that he
then tendered all present for signature certain articles which
he and the Rev. Samuel Skelton had drawn up together.
The essence of those articles was that in all causes, ecclesiastical
as well as political, the tenor of God’s word should be
followed.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> The alternative was banishment.</p>

<p>Morton claims that he alone of those present refused to
put his hand to this paper, insisting that a proviso should
first be added in these words, “So as nothing be done contrary
or repugnant to the laws of the Kingdom of England.”
These are almost the exact words of King Charles’s charter;<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>
and it would seem as though Morton, in proposing them,
sought an opportunity to display his legal acumen. Whether
his suggestion was adopted, and the articles modified accordingly,
does not appear. It probably was, though the
change was not one which Endicott would have looked
upon with favor. If he assented to it he certainly did so
grimly. The matter of regulating the trade in beaver skins
was next brought up. This was intended to be a Company
monopoly, to meet the charge of providing churches and
forts.<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> It was accordingly proposed that a sort of general
partnership for the term of one year should be effected to
carry it on. Morton says that on this matter also he stood
out, and it seems altogether probable that he did. It is
safe to say that he was there to make whatever trouble he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
could. On the other hand it was not possible for Endicott
to mistake his instructions. They were as plain as words
could make them. He was to see to it that “none be partakers
of [the Company’s] privileges and profits, but such as
be peaceable men, and of honest life and conversation, and
desirous to live amongst us, and conform themselves to good
order and government.” And further, if any factious spirit
developed itself he was enjoined “to suppress a mischief
before it take too great a head ... which, if it may be
done by a temperate course, we much desire it, though with
some inconvenience, so as our government and privileges be
not brought in contempt.... But if necessity require a
more severe course, when fair means will not prevail, we
pray you to deal as in your discretions you shall think fittest.”
Such instructions as these, in Endicott’s hands to execute,
boded ill for Morton.</p>

<p>Matters soon came to a crisis. Morton paid no regard to
the Company’s trade regulations. The presumption is that he
was emboldened to take the course he now did by the belief
that he would find support in England. He unquestionably
was informed as to all the details of the trouble between the
Massachusetts Company and the Council for New England,
and knew that Oldham, whom he by the way speaks of as
“a mad Jack in his mood,”<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> held a grant from John Gorges,
and was straining every nerve to come out and take adverse
possession of the territory covered by it. He probably hoped,
day by day, to see Oldham appear at the head of a Gorges
expedition. There is reason to suppose that he was himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
at this time an agent of Gorges,&mdash;that, indeed, he had come
back to New England as such, and was playing a part very
much like that of a spy. He was certainly in such correspondence
with Sir Ferdinando as the means of communication
permitted, and the confidant of his plans.<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p>

<p>When, therefore, he offered all the opposition to Endicott
which he dared, and thwarted him so far as he could, he was
not acting for himself alone. He represented, in a degree at
least, what in England was a powerful combination. Accordingly,
with an over-confidence in the result born of his sanguine
faith in the power and influence of his patron, he now
seems to have gone back to the less objectionable of his old
courses. He did not renew the trade in fire-arms and ammunition,
for he probably had none to spare, and experience
had taught him how dangerous it was. He did, however,
deal with the savages as he saw fit, and on his own account,
openly expressing his contempt for Endicott’s authority, and
doing all he could to excite the jealousy and discontent of
the “old planters.”<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> His own profits at this time were, he
says, six and seven fold.</p>

<p>This state of things could not continue. Accordingly, as
the year drew to a close, Endicott made an effort to arrest
him. Morton, however, was now on his guard. Getting
wind of what was intended, he concealed his ammunition
and most necessary goods in the forest; and, when the messengers,
sent across the bay to seize him, landed on the
beach at the foot of Mount Wollaston, he was nowhere to
be found. He says that they ransacked his house, and took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
from it all the provender they could find; but when they
were gone he replenished his supplies with the aid of his
gun, and “did but deride Captain Littleworth, that made
his servants snap shorte in a country so much abounding
with plenty of foode for an industrious man.” This happened
about Christmas, 1629.<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p>

<p>Could Endicott now have laid hands upon him there can
be little room for doubt that Morton would have been summarily
dealt with; but for the present the deputy-governor’s
attention was otherwise occupied. This was that
winter of 1629-30, the famine and sickness of which came so
near to bringing the Salem settlement to a premature end.
During that struggle for existence the magistrate had no
time to attend to Morton’s case. But he was not the man
to forget it.</p>

<p>With the following summer the great migration, which
was to fix the character of New England, began. Instead
of a vessel fitted out for Oldham under the patronage of
Gorges, the <i>Mary &amp; John</i>, chartered by the Massachusetts
Company and having on board 140 passengers from the
West of England, anchored off Hull on the 30th of May.
A fortnight later Governor Winthrop reached Salem, and
on the 17th of June he also came into Boston Harbor; and
Morton, from Mount Wollaston, must have watched his
vessel with anxious eyes as, in full view from his house, it
made its way up the channel to the mouth of the Mystic.
He must also have realized that its appearance in those
waters boded him no good.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>
<p>In a few days more the whole fleet, numbering twelve
sail in all, was at anchor off Charlestown, and the work of discharging
passengers was going actively on. Of these there
were nearly a thousand;<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> and now the busy and fatal summer
experience of 1630 was fairly entered upon.</p>

<p>For a few weeks longer Morton continued to live undisturbed
at Mount Wollaston. The confusion and bustle of
landing, and afterwards the terror and sense of bereavement
which followed hard on pestilence, protected him. It was
not until the 23d of August, or the present 2d of September,
that the magistrates held any formal session. They then met
at the great house at Charlestown,<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> as it would seem, Winthrop,
Dudley, Saltonstall, Pynchon, Bradstreet and others
being present. After some more important business had been
disposed of, “It was ordered, that Morton, of Mount Woolison,
should presently be sent for by processe.”<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> Of the circumstances
of his arrest under the warrant thus issued Morton
has given no account. Apparently he felt it was useless to
try to evade the messengers, and resistance was wholly out of
the question. At the next session of the magistrates, held
two weeks later, on what would now be the 17th of September,
he was formally arraigned. In addition to those already
named as being at the earlier meeting, Endicott was now
present. He had probably come down from Salem to give
his personal attention to Morton’s case. It must from the
outset have been apparent to the prisoner that the tribunal
before which he stood was one from which he had nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
to hope. The proceedings were in fact summary. It would
seem, from his own account of them,<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> that he endeavored to
humble himself, and, that failing, he made a sort of plea to
the jurisdiction of the Court. Neither submission nor plea
produced any effect. On the contrary he was apparently
cut short in his defence and his protest by impatient exclamations,
and even bidden to hold his peace and hearken to
his sentence. It appears in the records as <span class="lock">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It is ordered by this present Court, that Thomas Morton, of Mount Walliston,
shall presently be sett into the bilbowes, and after sent prisoner into
England, by the shipp called the <i>Gifte</i>, nowe returning thither; that all his
goods shalbe seazed upon to defray the charge of his transportation, payment
of his debts, and to give satisfaction to the Indians for a cannoe hee unjustly
tooke away from them; and that his howse, after the goods are taken out, shalbe
burnt downe to the ground in the sight of the Indians, for their satisfaction,
for many wrongs hee hath done them from tyme to tyme.”<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p></div>

<p>Unfortunately, Winthrop’s admonitory remarks in imposing
this sentence have not been preserved. There is, however,
in the <i>New Canaan</i>, an expression which apparently
formed a part of them.<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> It is that in which it is assigned as
a reason for the destruction of the house at Mount Wollaston,
that “the habitation of the wicked should no more
appear in Israel.” In compliance with the terms of this
sentence, Morton was set in the stocks; and while there, he
tells us, the savages came and looked at him, and wondered
what it all meant. He was not, however, sent back to England
in the <i>Gift</i>, as the master of that vessel declined to
carry him; for what reason does not appear. It was not in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
fact until nearly four months after his arrest that a passage
was secured for him in the <i>Handmaid</i>. Even then, Maverick
afterwards stated that Morton, obdurate to the last,
refused to go on board the vessel, upon the ground that he
had no call to go there, and so had to be hoisted over her
side by a tackle.<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> His house also was burned down; but the
execution of this part of his sentence, he asserts,&mdash;and his
assertion is confirmed by Maverick,&mdash;was vindictively delayed
until he was on his way into banishment, when it was
executed rather in his sight, it would seem, than in that of
the savages. Of the voyage to England there is an account
in the <i>New Canaan</i> that is rather more rambling and incoherent
than is usual even with Morton.<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a></p>

<p>The <i>Handmaid</i> appears to have been unseaworthy, and
insufficiently supplied. She had a long and tempestuous
passage, in the course of which Morton came very near
starving, no provision having been made for his subsistence
except a very inadequate one out of his own supplies.</p>

<p>The second arrest of Morton was equally defensible with
the first. According to his own account he had systematically
made himself a thorn in Endicott’s side. He had
refused to enter into any covenants, whether for trade or
government, and he had openly derided the magistrate and
eluded his messengers. This could not be permitted. He
dwelt within the limits of the Massachusetts charter, and the
Company was right when it instructed Endicott that all living
there “must live under government and a like law.”
It was necessary, therefore, that Morton should either give in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
his adhesion, or that he should be compelled to take himself
off. This, however, was not the ground which the magistrates
took. Nothing was said in the sentence of any disregard of
authority or disobedience to regulation. No reference was
made to any illicit dealings with the Indians, or to the trade
in fire-arms. Offences of this kind would have justified the
extreme severity of a sentence which went to the length of
ignominious physical punishment, complete confiscation of
property and banishment; leaving only whipping, mutilation
or death uninflicted. No such offences were alleged.
Those which were alleged, on the contrary, were of the most
trivial character. They were manifestly trumped up for the
occasion. The accused had unjustly taken away a canoe from
some Indians; he had fired a charge of shot among a troop
of them who would not ferry him across a river, wounding one
and injuring the garments of another; he was “a proud, insolent
man” against whom a “multitude of complaints were
received, for injuries done by him both to the English and
the Indians.”<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> Those specified, it may be presumed, were
examples of the rest. They amount to nothing at all, and
were afterwards very fitly characterized by Maverick as
mere pretences. Apparently conscious of this, Dudley, the
deputy-governor, in referring to the matter a few months
later in his letter to the Countess of Lincoln, says that
Morton was sent to England “for that my Lord Chief
Justice there so required, that he might punish him capitally
for fouler misdemeanors there perpetrated.” Bradford
also, in referring to the matter, states that Morton was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
“vehemently suspected” of a murder, and that “a warrant
was sent from the Lord Chief Justice to apprehend him.”<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a></p>

<p>There can be no doubt that there was a warrant from the
King’s Bench against Morton in Winthrop’s hands,<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> but in
all probability it was nothing more nor less than a sort of
English <i>lettre de cachet</i>. Morton’s record in New England
was perfectly well known in London at the time Winthrop
was making his preparations to cross. His relations with
Oldham and Gorges must often have been discussed at the
assistants’ meetings, and they were not ignorant of the fact
that he had gone back to Plymouth with Allerton. They
must have suspected that he went back as an agent or emissary
of Gorges, and they may have known that he so went
back. In any event, they did not propose to have him live
within the limits of their patent. He was an undesirable
character. The warrant, therefore, was probably obtained
in advance, on some vague report or suspicion of a criminal
act, to be at hand and ready for use when needed.<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> It could
not legally run into New England, any more than it could
into Scotland or Ireland.<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> Then, and at no later time, would
Winthrop have recognized it in any other case; and, even
in this case, no reference is made to it in the colony records.
Had it been so referred to, it might have been cited as a
precedent.</p>

<p>Moreover such a requisition, though it might have warranted
the return of Morton to England, certainly did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
warrant the confiscation of all his property and the burning
of his house in advance of trial and conviction there. In
point of fact the requisition was a mere pretext and cover.
The Massachusetts magistrates, so far as Morton was concerned,
had made up their minds before he stood at their bar.
He was not only a “libertine,” as they termed it, but he was
suspected of being a spy. His presence at Mount Wollaston
they did not consider desirable, and so they proposed to purge
the country of him; and if not in one way, then in another.
His case is not singular in Massachusetts annals; it is merely
the first of its kind. It established a precedent much too
often followed thereafter. Morton was one of those who, as
it was expressed in a tract of the time printed in London,
“must have elbow-roome, and cannot abide to be so pinioned
with the strict government in the Commonwealth, or discipline
in the church. Now why should such live there? As
Ireland will not brooke venomous beasts, so will not that
land [New England] vile persons and loose livers.”<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a></p>

<p>Many times, in the years which followed, the country was
purged of other of these “vile persons and loose livers,” in
much the same way that it was now purged of Morton. It
may, however, well be questioned whether it ever derived benefit
from the process. Certainly Morton’s case was as strong
as any case well could be. There was absolutely nothing to
be said in his favor. He was a lawless, reckless, immoral
adventurer. And yet, as the result will show, in sending Morton
back to England, the victim of high-handed justice, the
Massachusetts magistrates committed a serious blunder. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
had much better have left him alone under the harrow of
their authority. At Mount Wollaston he was at worst but a
nuisance. They drove him away from there and sent him
back to London; and at Whitehall he became a real danger.
This part of history is now to be told.</p>

<p>Bradford says, and he is generally correct in his statements,
that when at last Morton reached England “he lay
a good while in Exeter jail.”<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> There is no allusion to anything
of the sort in the <i>New Canaan</i>; and it would not seem
that he could have been very long a prisoner, as the next
assizes and jail-delivery must have set him free. There could
have been nothing on which to make him stand a trial.
Accordingly the following year he was at liberty and busily
concerned in Gorges’s intrigues for the overthrow of the
Massachusetts charter.</p>

<p>The house in which Gorges lived&mdash;as formerly it had
been the point of gathering of all who had visited the American
coast, or could add anything to the stock of information
concerning it&mdash;was now the headquarters for those who had
any complaint to make or charges to prefer against the
magistracy of Massachusetts. Acting in concert with Captain
John Mason, the patentee of New Hampshire, he was exerting
himself to the utmost to secure a revocation of King Charles’s
charter. The attack was made on the 19th of December,
1632, and it was a formidable one. It assumed the shape of
a petition to the Privy Council, asking the Lords to inquire
into the methods through which the royal charter for the
Massachusetts Bay had been procured, and into the abuses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
which had been practised under it. Besides many injuries
inflicted on individuals in their property and persons, the
Company was also charged with seditious and rebellious
designs, subversive alike of church and of state. The various
allegations were based on the affidavits of three witnesses,&mdash;Thomas
Morton, Philip Ratcliff and Sir Christopher Gardiner.
Behind these was the active and energetic influence
of Gorges and Mason.<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></p>

<p>It is not necessary in this connection to go into any
detailed statement of the wrongs complained of by Ratcliff
and Gardiner. They were of the same nature, though even
more pronounced than those of Morton. The country had
in fact been purged of all three of these individuals. The
original document in which they set forth their cases, and
made accusation against the magistrates, has unfortunately
been lost. In referring to it afterwards Winthrop said that
it contained “some truths misrepeated.”<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> Apart from severe
judgments on alleged wrong-doers, including whipping,
branding, mutilating, banishment and confiscation of property,
the burden of the accusation lay in the disposition to
throw off allegiance to the mother country, which was distinctly
charged against the colony.</p>

<p>A harsh coloring was doubtless given in the petition to
whatever could be alleged. So far as casting off their allegiance
to the mother country was concerned, nothing can
be more certain than that neither the leaders nor the
common people of New England entertained at that time
any thought of it; but it is quite equally certain that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
leaders at least were deeply dissatisfied with the course public
affairs were then taking in England. They were Puritans,
and this was the period of the Star Chamber and the High
Commission. No parliament had been called since 1629,
and it was then publicly announced at Court that no
more parliaments were to be called. There is no reason
to suppose that the early settlers of Massachusetts were a
peculiarly reticent race. On the contrary it is well known
that they were much given to delivering themselves and
bearing evidence on all occasions; and in doing so they
unquestionably railed and declaimed quite freely against
those then prominent in the council-chamber and among
the bishops. That there was a latent spirit in New England
ripe for rebellion was also, probably, asserted in the lost
document. However Winthrop might deny it, and deny it
honestly, this also was true; and subsequent events, both in
Massachusetts and in England, showed it to be so. In the
light of their sympathies and sufferings, Morton and Gardiner
probably realized the drift of what they had heard said
and seen done in New England a good deal better than
Winthrop.</p>

<p>The result of the Morton-Gardiner petition was the appointment
of a committee of twelve Lords of the Council,
to whom the whole matter was referred for investigation and
report. The committee was empowered to send for persons
and papers and a long and apparently warm hearing ensued.
The friends of the Company found it necessary to at once
bestir themselves. Cradock, Saltonstall and Humfrey filed a
written answer to the complaint, and subsequently, at the
hearing, they received efficient aid from Emanuel Downing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
Winthrop’s brother-in-law, and Thomas Wiggin, who lived
at Piscataqua, but now most opportunely chanced to be in
London.</p>

<p>At the Court of Charles I. everything was matter of influence
or purchase. The founders of Massachusetts were men
just abreast of their time, and not in advance of it. There
is good ground on which to suspect that they did not hesitate
to have recourse to the means then and there necessary
to the attainment of their ends. It has never been explained,
for instance, how the charter of 1629 was originally secured.<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a>
When Allerton, at the same time, tried to obtain a similar
charter for the Plymouth colony, he found that he had to
buy his way at every step, and Bradford complained bitterly
of the “deale of money veainly and lavishly cast away.”<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> That
the original patentees of Massachusetts bribed some courtier
near the King, and through him bought their charter, is
wholly probable. Every one bribed, and almost every one
about the King took bribes. That the patentees had powerful
influence at Court is certain; exactly where it lay is not
apparent. The Earl of Warwick interested himself actively
in their behalf. It was he who secured for them their patent
from the Council for New England. But Warwick, though
a powerful nobleman, was “a man in no grace at Court;”
on the contrary, he was one of those “whom his Majesty had
no esteem of, or ever purposed to trust.”<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> Winthrop says
that in the Morton-Gardiner hearing his brother-in-law,
Emanuel Downing, was especially serviceable.<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> Downing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
was a lawyer of the Inner Temple.<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> There is reason to
suppose that he had access to influential persons,&mdash;possibly
Lord Dorchester may have been amongst them.<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> However
this may be, whether by means of influence or bribery, the
hearing before the Committee of the Privy Council was
made to result disastrously for the complainants. Gorges
took nothing by his motion. In due time the Committee
reported against any interference with the Company at that
time. Such grounds of complaint as did not admit of explanation
they laid to the “faults or fancies of particular men,”
and these, they declared, were “in due time to be inquired
into.” King Charles himself also had evidently been labored
with through the proper channels, and not without effect.
Not only did he give his approval to the report of the Committee,
but he went out of his way to further threaten with
condign punishment those “who did abuse his governor and
the plantation.”</p>

<p>Gorges’s carefully prepared attack had thus ended in complete
failure. The danger, however, had been great, nor
was its importance underestimated in Massachusetts. This
clearly appears in Winthrop’s subsequent action; for when,
four months later, in May, 1633, information of the final
action of the Council reached him, he wrote a letter of grave
jubilation to Governor Bradford, giving him the glad news,
and inviting him to join “in a day of thanksgiving to our
mercifull God, who, as he hath humbled us by his late correction,
so he hath lifted us up, by an abundante rejoysing in
our deliverance out of so desperate a danger.”<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>

<p>Though badly defeated, and for the time being no doubt
discouraged, Gorges and Morton were not disposed to desist
from their efforts. As the latter expressed it, they had been
too eager, and had “effected the business but superficially.”<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a>
They had also committed the serious mistake of underestimating
the strength and influence of their antagonists. If
Gorges, however, was at home anywhere, he was at home
just where he had now received his crushing defeat,&mdash;in the
antechambers of the palace. All his life he had been working
through Court influences. Through them, after the
Essex insurrection, he had saved his neck from the block.
If Court influence would have availed to secure it, in 1623
he would have pre-empted the whole territory about Boston
Bay as the private domain of himself and his descendants.
At Whitehall he was an enemy not lightly to be disregarded;
and this Winthrop and his colleagues soon had
cause to realize.</p>

<p>Thwarted by strong influences in one direction, Gorges
went to work to secure stronger influences in another direction.
He knew the ground, and his plan of operations was
well conceived. To follow it out in detail is not possible.
Here and there a fact appears; the rest is inference and surmise.
The King was the objective point. Of him it is not
necessary here to speak at length, for his character is too
well understood. Dignified in his bearing, and in personal
character purer than his times,&mdash;a devout, well-intentioned
man,&mdash;Charles was a shallow, narrow-minded bigot, with a
diseased belief in that divinity which doth hedge a king. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
would have made an ideal, average English country gentleman.
After the manner of small, obstinate men, he believed
intensely in a few things. One was his own royal supremacy
and his responsibility, not to his people but to his kingship.
He was nothing of a statesman, and as a politician
he was his own worst enemy. His idea of government was
the Spanish one: the king had a prime-minister, and that
prime-minister was the king’s other and second self. In
Charles’s case Buckingham was at first prime-minister; and,
when Buckingham was assassinated, he was in due time succeeded
by Laud. Abbot, Archbishop of Canterbury, had
not died until August 4, 1633, and a few days later Laud
was appointed to succeed him. He thus became primate
almost exactly eight months after the first attack on the
charter. It was through him that Gorges now went to work
to influence the King and to control the course of events
in New England. His method can be explained in four
words: Laud hated a Puritan.</p>

<p>At first the secret connection of Gorges and Morton with
the events which now ensued is matter of pure surmise.
There is no direct evidence of it in the records or narratives.
At a later period it becomes more apparent. As a
matter of surmise, however, based on the subsequent development
of events, it seems probable that in February, 1634, the
attention of the Archbishop, and through him that of the
Privy Council, was called to the large emigration then going
on to New England of “persons known to be ill-affected and
discontented, as well with the civil as ecclesiastical government.”<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a>
As Gorges himself expressed it, “numbers of people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
of all sorts flocked thither in heaps.”<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> Several vessels, already
loaded with passengers and stores, were then lying in the
Thames. An Order in Council was forthwith issued staying
these vessels, and calling upon Cradock to produce the Company’s
charter. So far as the vessels were concerned it soon
appeared that the Company was still not without friends in
the Council; and, “for reasons best known to their Lordships,”
they were permitted to sail.<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> Doubtless this detention,
as the subsequent more rigid restraint, was “grounded
upon the several complaints that came out of those parts of
the divers sects and schisms that were amongst them, all contemning
the public government of the ecclesiastical state.”
Ratcliff was now looked upon as a lunatic,<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> and Gardiner
had disappeared. Morton alone remained; and it is safe to
surmise that he was the fountain-head of these complaints,
as Gorges was the channel which conveyed them to Laud.
As respects the charter, Cradock made reply to the order
for its production that it was not in his hands,&mdash;that Winthrop,
four years before, had taken it to New England. He
was directed to send for it at once. Here the matter rested,
and to all appearances Gorges had met with one more
check. The release of the vessels was ordered on the last
day of February, 1634.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>

<p>A new move on the chess-board was now made by some
one. Who that some-one was is again matter of surmise.
Hitherto the few matters which from time to time came up,
relating to the colonies, had been considered in the full
Privy Council. There the Massachusetts Company had
shown itself a power. Special tribunals, however, were at
this juncture greatly in vogue at Whitehall. The Council
of the North, the Star Chamber, the Court of High Commission,
were in full operation. To them all political work
was consigned, and in the two last Laud was supreme. Up
to this time, however, the need of any special tribunal to
look after the affairs of the colonies had not made itself felt.
The historians of New England have philosophized a great
deal over the considerations of state which, during the reign
of Charles, dictated the royal policy towards New England;<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a>
but it is more than doubtful whether considerations of state
had anything to do with that policy. The remoteness and
insignificance of early New England, so far as the English
Court was concerned, is a thing not easy now to realize. It
may be taken for certain that King and Primate rarely gave
a thought to it, much less matured a definite or rational policy.
Their minds were full of more important matters.
They were intent on questions of tonnage and poundage,
on monopolies, and all possible ways and means of raising
money; they were thinking of the war with Spain, of Wentworth’s
Irish policy, of the English opposition, and the
Scotch church system. So far as New England was concerned
they were mere puppets to be jerked to and fro by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
the strings of Court influence,&mdash;now granting a charter at
the instance of one man, and then restraining vessels at the
instance of another,&mdash;defending “our governor” one day,
and threatening to have his ears cropped the next.</p>

<p>In certain quarters it seems now, however, to have been
decided that this condition of affairs was to continue no
longer. A special tribunal should be created, to take charge
of all colonial matters. This move seems to have grown
out of the Order in Council of February 21, and to have
been directed almost exclusively to the management of
affairs in New England, whence complaint mainly came.
Accordingly, on the 10th of April, a commission passed the
great seal establishing a board with almost unlimited power
of regulating plantations. Laud was at the head of it.
There would seem to be every reason to assume that this
tribunal was created at the suggestion of Laud, and in consequence
of the undecided course pursued by the Council as
a whole, two months before, in the matter of the detained
vessels. A further inference, from what went before and
what followed, is that Laud’s action was stimulated and
shaped by Gorges. He was the active promoter of complaints
and scandals from New England. In other words,
the organization of this colonial board, through Laud’s influence
and with Laud supreme in it, was Gorges’s first move
in the next and most formidable attack on the charter of the
Massachusetts Bay.</p>

<p>The plan now matured by Gorges was a large one. He
had no idea of being balked of the prize which it had been
the dream and the effort of his life to secure. He meant
yet to grasp a government for himself, and an inheritance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
for his children, in New England. So far as the settlement
of that country was concerned, what he for thirty years
had been vainly ruining himself to bring about was now
accomplishing itself; but it was accomplishing itself not only
without his aid, but in a way which gravely threatened his
interests. The people who were swarming to New England
refused to recognize his title, and abused and expelled his
agents. It was clear that the Council for New England was
not equal to dealing with such a crisis. It was necessary to
proceed through some other agency. The following scheme
was, therefore, step by step devised.</p>

<p>The territory held under the great patent of the Council
for New England extended from Maine to New Jersey.
This whole region was, by the action of the Council, to be
divided in severalty among its remaining members, and the
patent was then to be surrendered to the King, who thereupon
was to confirm the division just made.<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> The Council
being thus gotten out of the way, the King was to assume
the direct government of the whole territory, and was to
appoint a governor-general for it. Sir Ferdinando Gorges
was to be that governor-general.<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> He would thus go out
to his province clothed with full royal authority; and
the issue would then be, not between the settlers of Massachusetts,
acting under the King’s charter, and that “carcass
in a manner breathless,” the Council for New England, but
between a small body of disobedient subjects and the King’s
own representative. The scheme was a well-devised one.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
It was nothing more nor less than the colonial or New England
branch of Strafford’s “Thorough.” It was a part,
though a small part, of a great system.</p>

<p>The first step in carrying out the programme was to secure
the appointment of the Commission of April 10. The influence
of the Archbishop being assured, there was no difficulty
in this. The board was composed of twelve members of the
Privy Council. Laud himself was at the head of it, and with
him were the Archbishop of York, the Earls of Portland,
Manchester, Arundel and Dorset, Lord Cottington, Sir
Thomas Edmunds, Sir Henry Vane, and Secretaries Cooke
and Windebank. Any five or more of these Commissioners
were to constitute a <i>quorum</i>, and their powers were of the
largest description. They could revoke all charters previously
granted, remove governors and appoint others in the
places of those removed, and even break up settlements if
they deemed it best so to do. They could inflict punishment
upon all offenders, either by imprisonment, “or by loss of life
or member.” It was in fact a commission of “right divine.”
It embodied the whole royal policy of King Charles, as formulated
by Wentworth and enforced by Laud. The new
Commission was not slow in proceeding to its appointed work,
and the potency of Gorges’s influence in it was shown by his
immediate designation as governor-general.<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> How close
Morton then stood to him may be inferred from the following
letter, which shows also that he was well informed as to all
that was going on.<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> It was written exactly three weeks after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
the appointment of the Commission, and was addressed to
William Jeffreys at <span class="lock">Wessagusset:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">My very good Gossip</span>,&mdash;If I should commend myself to you, you reply
with this proverb,&mdash;<i>Propria laus fordet in ore</i>: but to leave impertinent salute,
and really to proceed.&mdash;You shall hereby understand, that, although, when I
was first sent to England to make complaint against Ananias and the brethren,
I effected the business but superficially, (through the brevity of time,) I have
at this time taken more deliberation and brought the matter to a better pass.
And it is thus brought about, that the King hath taken the business into his own
hands. The Massachusetts Patent, by order of the council, was brought in
view; the privileges there granted well scanned upon, and at the council board
in public, and in the presence of Sir Richard Saltonstall and the rest, it was
declared, for manifest abuses there discovered, to be void. The King hath
reassumed the whole business into his own hands, appointed a committee of
the board, and given order for a general governor of the whole territory to be
sent over. The commission is passed the privy seal, I did see it, and the same
was 1 mo. Maii sent to the Lord Keeper to have it pass the great seal for
confirmation; and I now stay to return with the governor, by whom all complainants
shall have relief:<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> So that now Jonas being set ashore may safely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>

asunder. Repent you cruel schismatics, repent.<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> These things have happened,
and I shall see, (notwithstanding their boasting and false alarms in the Massachusetts,
with feigned cause of thanksgiving,) their merciless cruelty rewarded,
according to the merit of the fact, with condign punishment for coming into
these parts, like Sampson’s foxes with fire-brands at their tails.<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> The King
and Council are really possessed of their preposterous loyalty and irregular
proceedings, and are incensed against them: and although they be so opposite
to the catholic axioms, yet they will be compelled to perform them, or
at leastwise, suffer them to be put in practice to their sorrow. In matter of
restitution and satisfaction, more than mystically, it must be performed visibly,
and in such sort as may be subject to the senses in a very lively image. My
Lord Canterbury having, with my Lord Privy Seal, caused all Mr. Cradock’s
letters to be viewed, and his apology in particular for the brethren here, protested
against him and Mr. Humfrey, that they were a couple of imposterous
knaves; so that, for all their great friends, they departed the council chamber
in our view with a pair of cold shoulders. I have staid long, yet have not
lost my labor, although the brethren have found their hopes frustrated; so
that it follows by consequence, I shall see my desire upon mine enemies: and
if John Grant had not betaken him to flight, I had taught him to sing clamavi
in the Fleet before this time, and if he return before I depart, he will pay
dear for his presumption. For here he finds me a second Perseus: I have
uncased Medusa’s head, and struck the brethren into astonishment. They
find, and will yet more to their shame, that they abuse the word and are to
blame to presume so much,&mdash;that they are but a word and a blow to them
that are without. Of these particulars I thought good, by so convenient a
messenger, to give you notice, lest you should think I had died in obscurity,
as the brethren vainly intended I should, and basely practised, abusing justice
by their sinister practices, as by the whole body of the committee, <i>una voce</i>,
it was concluded to be done, to the dishonor of his majesty. And as for Ratcliffe,
he was comforted by their lordships with the cropping of Mr. Winthrop’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
ears: which shows what opinion is held amongst them of King Winthrop with
all his inventions and his Amsterdam fantastical ordinances, his preachings,
marriages, and other abusive ceremonies, which do exemplify his detestation
to the Church of England, and the contempt of his majesty’s authority and
wholesome laws, which are and will be established in these parts, <i>invitâ Minervâ</i>.
With these I thought fit to salute you, as a friend, by an epistle, because
I am bound to love you, as a brother, by the gospel, resting your loving

THOMAS MORTON.<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a>
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dated 1 Mo. Maii, 1634.</span></p></div>

<p>Morton is always confused and inaccurate in his statements,
and this letter afforded no exception to the rule. It
is impossible to be quite sure of what particular occasions he
refers to in it. He may in the same breath be speaking of
different things. Whether, for instance, the hearing to
which he alludes, at which the patent “was brought in
view,” was the same or another meeting from that in which
Cradock’s letters were produced, is not clear. It would
seem as though he were speaking of the February hearing
before the whole Council, and yet he may be describing a
subsequent hearing in April before the Lords Commissioners.
He speaks of the “council chamber” and of “the whole
body of the Committee,” and then alludes to the presence of
Saltonstall, Humfrey and Cradock. Now these persons
were before the Council in the hearing of 1632, and they
may all of them, as Cradock certainly was, have been before
it in February 1634; but Humfrey could hardly have appeared
before the Lords Commissioners, as he seems to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
sailed for New England early in the month during which
they were appointed. The meeting which Morton describes,
therefore, was probably that of February 28, 1634; and it
would seem to have savored strongly of the Star Chamber
and High Commission. Cradock and Humfrey were apparently
scolded and abused by Laud in the style for which he
was famous, and the admission by the former, that the charter
had gone to America, had led to his being called “an
imposterous knave,” and sharply told to send for it back at
once. The well-known foibles of the Primate had been
skilfully played upon by accounts of Winthrop’s “Amsterdam
fantastical ordinances, his preachings, marriages, and
other abusive ceremonies;” and they had much the effect that
a red flag is known to have on a bull. Nothing was now
heard of the King’s intention of severely punishing those
who abused “his governor;” but, on the contrary, Ratcliffe
was “comforted with the cropping of Mr. Winthrop’s ears.”
Gorges was governor-general, and with him Morton expected
soon to depart.</p>

<p>Cradock’s letter, enclosing the order of the Council for
the return of the charter, reached Boston in July. Winthrop
was then no longer governor, having been displaced
by Dudley at the previous May election. As is well known
to all students of New England history, the famous parchment,
still in the office of the secretary of the Puritan Commonwealth,
was not sent back.<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> It is unnecessary, however,
to here repeat the story of the struggle over it. Presently
Governor Edward Winslow of Plymouth was despatched to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
England, as the joint agent of the two colonies, to look after
their endangered interests. He reached London in the
autumn of 1634, bringing with him an evasive reply to
the demand contained in Cradock’s letter.</p>

<p>Winslow sailed in the middle or latter part of July, and a
few days later, on the 4th of August,<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> Jeffreys came over from
Wessagusset to Boston, bringing to Winthrop the letter which
he had shortly before received from Morton. It was the first
intimation the magistrates had of the Commission and of the
appointment of a governor-general. Winthrop communicated
the news to Dudley and the other members of the
Council, and to some of the ministers; and, doubtless, for a
time they all nursed an anxious hope that the exaggerations
in the letter were even greater than they really were. The
General Court met on the 25th of August. While it was
still in session, vessels arrived bringing tidings which dispelled
all doubt, and confirmed everything material that Morton
had said. He whom the magistrates had so ignominiously
punished, and so contemptuously driven away, was evidently
in a position to know what those in authority intended. It
began to be evident that the Massachusetts magistrates had
underestimated an opponent.</p>

<p>A full copy of the Order in Council establishing the board
of Lords Commissioners of Plantations, was now received,
and the colonists were further advised, through their private
letters, that ships were being furnished, and soldiers gotten
ready for embarkation in them. It was given out that these
troops and vessels were intended for Virginia, whither a new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
governor was about to be sent; but Winthrop wrote that
in Massachusetts the preparation was “suspected to be
against us, to compel us by force to receive a new governor,
and the discipline of the church of England, and the
laws of the commissioners.<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a>”</p>

<p>The answer which best expressed the spirit of the colony,
in reply to Laud’s threats, was now found, not in the missive
which Winslow had in charge, but in the act of Morton’s
old oppressor, Endicott, when a few weeks later at Salem he
cut the red cross from the standard. It was an act, however,
which seemed to indicate that there was more truth than
Winthrop was disposed to admit in Gardiner and Morton’s
charge that “the ministers and people did continually rail
against the state, church and bishops.”<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> Six months of great
alarm and strenuous preparation now ensued. Steps were
taken to get together arms and ammunition, and defences
were ordered at Dorchester and Charlestown, as well as at
Castle Island. The magistrates were even empowered to
impress laborers for the work. In January the ministers were
summoned to Bolton, and the question formally submitted to
them: “What ought we to do if a general governor should
be sent out of England?” The reply was that “we ought
not to accept him, but defend our lawful possessions if we are
able.” In April a rumor of strange vessels hovering off
Cape Ann threw the whole province into a tumult. It was
supposed that Governor-general Gorges, with Morton in his
train, was at the harbor’s mouth. It proved to be a false
alarm, and after that the excitement seems gradually to have
subsided.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>

<p>This was in the spring of 1635. Meanwhile Winslow had
reached England sometime early in the previous autumn.
Though he had not brought the charter with him, its production
does not seem to have been again immediately
called for. He probably held out confident assurances that
it would be sent over in the next vessel, as soon as the
General Court met; but it is also probable that, in view of
the course which had now been decided upon, an examination
of it was no longer deemed necessary. The ensuing
spring, that of 1635, had been fixed upon by Gorges and
Mason as the time for decisive action. The charter was
then to be vacated, and Gorges was to go out to New England
with a force sufficient to compel obedience. All this,
however, implied considerable preparation. Shipping had
to be provided in the first place. A large vessel was accordingly
put upon the stocks. Rumor said, also, that the new
governor-general was to take out with him a force of no less
than one thousand soldiers.<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> Whether this was true or not,
there can be little doubt that all through the winter of
1634-5 active preparations were on foot in England intended
against the Massachusetts colony.</p>

<p>Besides watching these proceedings Winslow had other
business in London which required his appearance before the
Lords Commissioners. He had presented to them a petition
on behalf of the two colonies for authority to resist certain
Dutch and French encroachments. This proceeding Winthrop
had not thought well advised,<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> as he very shrewdly
argued that it implied an absence of authority without such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
special authorization, and might thus be drawn into a precedent.
Winslow, however, had none the less submitted the
petition, and several hearings were given upon it. Fully
advised as to everything that was going on before the Lords
Commissioners, Gorges did not favor this move. It authorized
military or diplomatic action, the conduct of which by
right belonged to him as governor-general of the region
within which the action was to be taken. He accordingly
went to work to circumvent Winslow. What ensued throws
a great deal of light on Morton’s standing at the time, and
the use that was made of him; and it also explains the significance
of certain things in the <i>New Canaan</i>.</p>

<p>Laud, it will be remembered, was the head and moving
spirit of the Lords Commissioners. His word was final in
the Board. Upon him Gorges depended to work all his results;
which included not only his own appointment as
governor-general, with full power and authority as such,
but also the necessary supply of men and money to enable
him to establish his supremacy. To secure these ends it was
necessary to play continually on the Primate’s dislike of the
Puritans, and his intense zeal in behalf of all Church forms
and ceremonies, including the use of the Book of Common
Prayer. The whole political and historical significance of
the <i>New Canaan</i> lies in this fact. It was a pamphlet designed
to work a given effect in a particular quarter, and
came very near being productive of lasting results. Dedicated
in form to the Lords Commissioners, it was charged
with attacks on the Separatists, and statements of the contempt
shown by them to the Book of Common Prayer.
Finally it contained one chapter on the church practices<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
in New England, which was clearly designed for the special
enlightenment of the Archbishop.<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> In this chapter it is set
down as the first and fundamental tenet of the New England
church “that it is the magistrate’s office absolutely, and
not the minister’s, to join the people in lawful matrimony;”
next, that to make use of a ring in marriage is a relic of
popery; and then again “that the Book of Common Prayer
is an idol; and all that use it idolaters.” It now remains to
show how cunningly, when it came to questions of state, Laud
was worked upon by these statements, and what a puppet he
became in the hands of Gorges and Morton.</p>

<p>Winslow’s suit had prospered. He had submitted to the
Lords Commissioners a plan for accomplishing the end
desired without any charge being imposed on the royal
exchequer, and he was on the point of receiving, as he
supposed, a favorable decision. Suddenly the secret strings
were pulled. Bradford best tells the story of what ensued.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“When Mr. Winslow should have had his suit granted, (as indeed upon the
point it was,) and should have been confirmed, the Archbishop put a stop
upon it, and Mr. Winslow, thinking to get it freed, went to the Board again.
But the Bishop, Sir Ferdinando and Captain Mason had, as it seems, procured
Morton to complain. To whose complaints Mr. Winslow made answer
to the good satisfaction of the Board, who checked Morton, and rebuked him
sharply, and also blamed Sir Ferdinando Gorges and Mason for countenancing
him. But the Bishop had a further end and use of his presence, for he
now began to question Mr. Winslow of many things, as of teaching in the
church publicly, of which Morton accused him and gave evidence that he
had seen and heard him do it; to which Mr. Winslow answered that sometimes
(wanting a minister) he did exercise his gift to help the edification of
his brethren, when they wanted better means, which was not often. Then
about marriage, the which he also confessed, that, having been called to place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
of magistracy, he had sometimes married some. And further told their lordships
that marriage was a civil thing, and he found nowhere in the word of
God that it was tied to ministry. Again they were necessitated so to do,
having for a long time together at first no minister; besides, it was no new
thing, for he had been so married himself in Holland, by the magistrates in
their Stadt-House. But in the end, to be short, for these things the Bishop, by
vehement importunity, got the Board at last to consent to his commitment.
So he was committed to the Fleet, and lay there seventeen weeks, or thereabout,
before he could get to be released. And this was the end of this petition
and this business; only the others’ design was also frustrated hereby, with
other things concurring, which was no small blessing to people here.”<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a></p></div>

<p>For the time being, however, “the others’ design,” as Bradford
describes Gorges’s scheme, so far from being frustrated,
moved on most prosperously. All the friends and agents
of the colony were now driven from the field. Cradock,
Saltonstall and Humfrey had departed the council-chamber
with “a pair of cold shoulders.” Winslow was a prisoner.
Morton had demonstrated that his boast in the letter to Jeffreys,
that he would make his opponents “sing <i>clamavi</i> in
the Fleet,” was not an idle one. He had not exaggerated
his power. Gorges’s course was now clear, and his plan
developed rapidly. At a meeting of those still members
of the Council for New England, held at Lord Gorges’s
house on the 3d of February, 1635, the next step was taken.
The redivision of the seacoast was agreed upon. It was
now divided into eight parcels, instead of twenty as at the
original abortive division of 1623; and these parcels were
assigned to eight several persons, among whom were the
Duke of Lenox, the Marquis of Hamilton, and the Earls of
Arundel, Carlisle and Sterling. Arundel alone of these was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
one of the Lords Commissioners. Gorges received Maine
as his portion; and Mason got New Hampshire and Cape
Ann. Massachusetts, south of Salem, was assigned to Lord
Gorges.</p>

<p>The division thus agreed on was to take effect simultaneously
with the formal surrender by the Council of its great
patent. Ten weeks later, on the 18th of April, at another
meeting at Lord Gorges’s house, a paper was read and entered
upon the records, in which the reasons for surrendering
the patent were set forth. At a subsequent meeting on
the 26th a petition to the King was approved, in which it
was prayed that separate patents might be issued securing to
the associates in severalty the domains they had assigned to
each other. A declaration from the King was also then
read, in which the royal intention of appointing Sir Ferdinando
Gorges governor-general of New England was formally
announced. Speaking by the mouth of the King, the
Primate did not propose “to suffer such numbers of people to
run to ruin, and to religious intents to languish, for want of
timely remedy and sovereign assistance.” Curiously enough,
also, this typically Laudian sentiment was enunciated at
Whitehall the very day, the 26th of April, 1635, upon which,
on the other side of the Atlantic, the Marblehead fishermen
had brought in word of strange vessels hovering mysteriously
upon the coast, causing the Governor and assistants
to hurry to Boston and an alarm to be spread through all
the towns.<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a></p>

<p>Before proceeding to eject the present occupants of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
New England soil, or to force them to some compromise as
an alternative thereto, it remained for the grantees of the
now defunct Council to perfect their new titles. Proceedings
to this end were not delayed. The division had been
agreed upon on the 3d of February, and on the 26th of
April the new patents had been petitioned for. Ten days
later Thomas Morton was “entertained to be solicitor for
confirmation of the said deeds under the great seal, as also
to prosecute suit at law for the repealing of the patent belonging
to the Massachusetts Company. And is to have for
fee twenty shillings a term, and such further reward as
those who are interested in the affairs of New England shall
think him fit to deserve, upon the judgment given in the
cause.” A month later, on the 7th of June, 1635, the formal
surrender of its patent by the Council took place.<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a></p>

<p>Morton, however, was not destined to land at Boston in
the train of Governor-general Gorges. The effort of 1634-5
was a mere repetition, on a larger and more impressive scale,
of the effort of 1623. The latter had resulted in the abortive
Robert Gorges expedition, and the former now set all
the courts at Westminster in solemn action. Neither of
them, however, came to anything. They both failed, also,
from the same cause,&mdash;want of money. The machinery in
each case was imposing, and there was a great deal of it.
Seen from New England it must have appeared simply overpowering.
The King, the Primate, the Lords Commissioners,
the Attorney General, the Court of King’s Bench, the
Great Seal, and a governor-general representing the Duke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
of Lenox, the Marquis of Hamilton and the Earls of Arundel,
Carlisle and Sterling, royal proprietors, were all at work
together to bring about the destruction of an infant colony.
When, however, it came to accomplishing anything in a
practical way, it grew apparent by degrees that behind all
this tremendous display of machinery there was nothing but
Sir Ferdinando Gorges,&mdash;an active-minded, adventurous
soldier, skilled in Court ways, persistent and full of resource,
but with small means of his own, and no faculty of obtaining
means from others. When it became therefore a question
of real action, calling for the sinews of war, the movement
flopped dead in 1635, just as it had stopped in 1623. In
1635 it is true, Gorges had the assistance of Captain John
Mason, who was an energetic man with means at his command,
and it was through him that a ship was to be provided.<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a>
The building of this ship, however, without doubt
strained to the utmost the resources of all concerned; and
when, in launching, it suffered a mishap, again probably
from insufficient means, they could not make the damage
good. The royal exchequer was then as empty as Gorges’s
own purse. The King was living on benevolences, and on
fines levied upon the great nobles for encroachments on the
royal forests. The writs to collect ship-money were issued
in this very year. The next year public offices were sold.
Under these circumstances no assistance could for the present
be looked for from Charles or Laud. As for the noble
associates, among whom the New England coast had just
been parcelled out, while perfectly willing to accept great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
domains in America, they would venture nothing more to
take actual possession of them in 1635 than they had ventured
in 1623. Nothing at all was to be obtained from that
quarter. Speaking of Gorges and Mason, and the failure
of their plans at this time, Winthrop wrote, “The Lord
frustrated their design.” This was the pious way of putting
it. In point of fact, however, the real safety of Massachusetts
now depended on more homely and every-day considerations.
Gorges and Mason could not raise the money absolutely
necessary to carry their design out.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, though this delay was disappointing, there
was no occasion for despair. Things moved slowly; that
was all. Gorges represented the New England part of that
royal system which was to stand or fall as a whole. In the
spring and summer of 1635 it looked very much as if it
was destined to stand. There was then no thought of a
parliament at Court, or expectation of one among the patriots.
The crown lawyers were hunting up precedents which
would enable the King to levy taxes to suit himself. Wentworth
had brought Ireland into a state of perfect subjection.
Laud was supreme in England. The prospects for “Thorough”
were never so good. If “Thorough” prevailed in
England it would in Massachusetts. There could be no
doubt of that. Meanwhile, though lack of ready means
had put it out of Gorges’s power to go to New England at
once, there was no break or delay in legal proceedings. In
June, 1635, the attorney-general filed in the King’s Bench a
writ of <i>quo warranto</i> against the Massachusetts Bay Company.
This was the work which Thomas Morton had a
month before been “entertained to prosecute,” and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
promptness of the attorney-general would seem to indicate
that on Morton’s part at least there was no failure in activity.
The plan was to set the charter aside, not because of
any abuse of the powers lawfully conferred in it, but on
the ground that it was void <i>ab initio</i>. Every title to land
held under it would thus be vitiated. In answer to the summons
some of the original associates came in and pleaded,
while others made default. Cradock made default. In his
case, therefore, judgment was given at the Michaelmas, or
September term, 1635, and the charter was declared void,
all the franchises conveyed in it being resumed by the King.<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a>
This portion of the legal work in hand, therefore, that
more particularly entrusted to Morton, seems to have been
promptly and efficiently done. As respects the patents for
the domains granted under the last partition, things do not
seem to have moved so rapidly, for towards the close of November
a meeting of the associates of the now dissolved
Council was held at the house of Lord Sterling, and a vote
passed that steps should be taken to get patents to the
individual patentees passed the seals as soon as possible.
Morton was in fact reminded of his duties.</p>

<p>A heavy blow was however impending over Gorges. He
himself was now an elderly man, verging close upon seventy
years.<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> He could not have been as active and as ener<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>getic
as he once had been, and even his sanguine disposition
must have felt the usual depressing influence of hope
long deferred. Mason had of late been the mainstay of
his enterprise. Only a year before, that resolute man had
sent out a large expedition, numbering some seventy men, to
Piscataqua, and he was contemplating extensive explorations
towards Lake Champlain. Morton eulogized him as a “very
good Commonwealth’s man, a true foster-father and lover of
virtue,”<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> and Winthrop referred to him as “the chief mover
in all the attempts against us.”<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> In December, 1635, Mason
died,<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> and not improbably it was the anticipation of his death
which led to that meeting of the Council at which the speedy
issuing of the individual patents was urged. However this
may be, the loss of Mason seems to have been fatal to Gorges’s
hopes; it was the lopping off of the right arm of his
undertakings. From that time forward there was obviously
no source from which he could hope to get the money
necessary to enable him to effect anything, except the royal
treasury. Of this, for two or three years yet, until the
Scotch troubles destroyed the last chance of the success of
the ship-money scheme, there seemed a very good prospect.
Gorges, however, could not afford to wait. His remaining
time was short. Accordingly, after Mason’s death, little is
heard of him or of the Lords Commissioners.</p>

<p>During the next seven years, consequently, the traces of
Morton are few. There is a passing glimpse obtained of
him in March, 1636, through a letter from Cradock to Winthrop,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a>
from which it appears he was then in London and
actively scheming against the Massachusetts Company. He
would seem at this time to have been in the pay of one
George Cleaves, a man of some importance and subsequently
quite prominent in the early history of Maine.
Cleaves apparently had proposed some scheme to Cradock
touching the Massachusetts Company, and Morton came to
see him about it. Thereupon Cradock says, “I having no
desire to speak with Morton alone put him off a turn or
two on the exchange, till I found Mr. Pierce,” etc. Further
on in the same letter he speaks of his “greyffe and
disdayne” at the abuse heaped on the Company, and of the
“heavey burdens, there lode on me by T. M.;” and adds,
“God forgive him that is the cause of it.”</p>

<p>Early in 1637, and in consequence probably of the <i>quo
warranto</i> proceedings, a commission of some sort would
appear to have been granted to certain persons in New
England for the government of that country.<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> How or under
what circumstances this was obtained is nowhere told.
There is a mystery about it. Gorges afterwards assured
Winthrop that he knew nothing of it,<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> and only a copy ever
reached America, the original, Winthrop says, being “staid
at the seal for want of paying the fees.” He further says
that Cleaves procured this commission, as also a sort of
patent, or, as he calls it, “a protection under the privy signet
for searching out the great lake of Iracoyce.” From all
this it would appear that the whole thing was some impotent
and inconsequential move on the part of Morton; for not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
only does Winthrop say that the document was “staid at the
seal,” but Cradock wrote that the matter in reference to
which Morton wanted to see him, on behalf of Cleaves, related
to paying the charge “in taking out somewhat under
the seale.” Gorges speaks of Morton as being at that time
Cleaves’s agent; and in the <i>New Canaan</i>, which either had
just been published or was then in the press, there is a
glowing account of the “great lake Erocoise,” and its boundless
wealth of beaver,<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> to which apparently the imaginative
author had directed Cleaves’s attention sufficiently to induce
him to take out the “protection” which Winthrop
alludes to.</p>

<p>The year 1637 was the turning-period in the fortunes of
King Charles and of Archbishop Laud, and consequently of
Gorges and Morton. Up to that time everything had gone
sufficiently well, if not in Massachusetts, at least in England,
Ireland, and even Scotland. Now, however, the system began
to break down; giving way first, as would naturally enough
be the case, at its weakest point. This was in Scotland, where
the attempt to force Episcopacy on the people resulted
in the famous “stony Sabbath” on the 23d of July. The
<i>New Canaan</i> was probably going through the press during
the deceitful period of profound calm which preceded that
eventful day. Though now published, there is strong internal
evidence that the book was written in 1634. Not only
does this appear from the extract from its last page in the
letter to Jeffreys, already referred to,<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> but in another place<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a>
there is reference to the expedition of Henry Josselyn for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
the more complete discovery of Lake Champlain, which is
mentioned as then in preparation. Henry Josselyn left
England about the time Morton was writing to Jeffreys, or
a little earlier, and reached Piscataqua in June, 1634.<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a>
Mason, on the other hand, is mentioned as then living,
and as having fitted out the expedition of Josselyn. Mason,
however, it has already been seen, died in December, 1635.
Written consequently after May, 1634, the <i>New Canaan</i>, it
would seem, received no revision later than 1635. It represented
Morton’s feelings during the time when he was most
confident of an early and triumphant return to New England.
It was published just when the affairs of Charles and
Laud were at their full flood, and before the tide had begun
to ebb.</p>

<p>No mention is found of the <i>New Canaan</i> at the time of
its publication. It is not known, indeed, that a single copy
was sent out to New England. Though it must have caused
no little comment and scandal among the friends and correspondents
of the colonists, there is no allusion to it in their
published letters or in the documents of the time, and in 1644
Winthrop apparently had never seen it. Bradford energetically
refers to it as “an infamouse and scurillous booke
against many godly and cheefe men of the cuntrie; full
of lyes and slanders, and fraight with profane callumnies
against their names and persons, and the ways of God.”<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> A
copy of it may, therefore, have been brought over to Plymouth
by one of the agents of the colony, and there passed
from hand to hand. It does not appear, however, that at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
the time it attracted any general or considerable notice in
America; while in England, of course, it would have interested
only a small class of persons.</p>

<p>There is one significant reference which would seem to
indicate that the publication of the <i>New Canaan</i> was not
agreeable to Gorges. However much he might attack the
charter of the Massachusetts Company, Sir Ferdinando always
showed himself anxious to keep on friendly terms with
the leading men of the colony. In the <i>Briefe Narration</i>
he takes pains to speak of “the patience and wisdom of
Mr. Winthrop, Mr. Humphreys, Mr. Dudley, and others
their assistants;”<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> and with Winthrop he was in correspondence,
even authorizing him and others to act for him in
Maine. He deceived no one by this, for Winthrop afterwards
described him as “pretending by his letters and
speeches to seek our welfare;”<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> but he evidently had always
in mind that he was to go out some day to New England
as a governor-general, and that it would not do for him to
be too openly hostile to those over whom he proposed to rule.
He regarded them as his people. When, therefore, he had
occasion to write to Winthrop in August, 1637, though he
made no reference to the <i>New Canaan</i>, which had probably
been published early in the year, he took pains to say that
Morton was “wholely casheered from intermedlinge with
anie our affaires hereafter.”<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a></p>

<p>It is however open to question whether, in making this
statement, Gorges was not practising a little of that king-craft
for which his master, James I., had been so famous. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
1637 Morton may have been in disgrace with him; but if
so it was a passing disgrace. Four years later, in 1641, Sir
Ferdinando, as “Lord of the Province of Maine,” indulged
his passion for feudal regulation by granting a municipal
charter to the town of Acomenticus, now York. A formidable
document of great import, this momentous state paper
was signed and delivered by the Lord Paramount, much as
an English sovereign might have granted a franchise to his
faithful city of London; and accordingly it was countersigned
by three witnesses, one of them a member of his own
family. First of the three witnesses to sign was Thomas
Morton.<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> He evidently was in no disgrace then.</p>

<p>With the exception of this signature to the Acomenticus
charter, there is no trace to be found of Morton between
August 1637, when Gorges wrote that he had “casheered”
him, and the summer of 1643, when he reappeared once
more at Plymouth. During the whole of that time things
evidently went with him, as they did with Charles and Laud,
from bad to worse. Once only had the Lords Commissioners
given any signs of life. This was in the spring of 1638,
when on the 4th of April the Board met at Whitehall. The
record of the meeting states that petitions and complaints
from Massachusetts, for want of a settled and orderly government,
were growing more frequent. This is very possible,
for the Antinomian Controversy was then at its height,
and indeed, the very day the Lords Commissioners met, Mrs.
Hutchinson, having left Boston in obedience to Governor
Winthrop’s mandate a week before, was on her way to join<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
her husband and friends in Rhode Island. Under these circumstances,
calling to mind the futile order for the return of
the charter, sent to Winthrop in 1634 through Cradock, and
taking official notice of the result of the <i>quo warranto</i> proceedings,
the Board resolved upon a more decided tone.
The clerk in attendance was instructed to send out to Massachusetts
a peremptory demand for the immediate surrender
of the charter. It was to be sent back to London by the
return voyage of the vessel which carried out the missive of
the Board; “it being resolved,” so that missive ran, “that
in case of any further neglect or contempt by them shewed
therein, their Lordships will cause a strict course to be
taken against them, and will move his Majesty to reassume
into his own hands the whole plantation.”<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a></p>

<p>If, as was probably the case, Morton was the secret mover
of this action, it proved to be his last effort. It was completely
fruitless also. When the order reached Boston, sometime
in the early summer of 1638, it naturally caused no
little alarm, for the apprehension of a general governor
had not yet disappeared. Indeed, on the 12th of April,
“a general fast [had been] kept through all the churches, by
advice from the Court, for seeking the Lord to prevent evil
that we feared to be intended against us from England by a
general governor.”<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> With the missive of the Lords Commissioners,
however, came also tidings of “the troubles which
arose in Scotland about the Book of Common Prayer and
the canons which the King would have forced upon the
Scotch churches.”<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> The result was that in August, instead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
of sending out the charter, Governor Winthrop, at the direction
of the General Court, wrote “to excuse our not sending
of it; for it was resolved to be best not to send it.”<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a></p>

<p>Archbishop Laud molested the colony no further. Doubtless
Morton yet endeavored more than once to stir him up
to action, and the next year he received from New England
other and bitter complaints of the same character as those
which had come to him before. This time it was the Rev.
George Burdet&mdash;a disreputable clergyman, subsequently a
thorn in Gorges’s side as now in that of Winthrop&mdash;who
wrote to him. The harassed and anxious Primate could,
however, only reply that “by reason of the much business
now lay upon them, [the Lords Commissioners] could not
at present ... redress such disorders as he had informed
them of.”<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> Events in England and Scotland were then
moving on rapidly as well as steadily to their outcome, and
Massachusetts was bidden to take care of itself.</p>

<p>Nothing more is heard of Morton until the summer of
1643. The Civil War was then dragging along in its earlier
stages, before Fairfax and Cromwell put their hands to it.
It was the summer during which Prince Rupert took Bristol
and the first battle of Newbury was fought,&mdash;the summer
made memorable by the deaths of Hampden and Falkland.
Gorges had identified himself with the Royalist side, and now
Morton seems to have been fairly starved out of England.
When or how he came to Plymouth we do not know; but,
on the 11th of September, Edward Winslow, whom he had
eight years before “clapte up in the Fleete,”<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> thus wrote to
<span class="lock">Winthrop:&mdash;</span></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Concerning Morton, our Governor gave way that he should winter here,
but begone as soon as winter breaks up. Captain Standish takes great offence
thereat, especially that he is so near him as Duxbury, and goeth sometimes a
fowling in his ground. He cannot procure the least respect amongst our people,
liveth meanly at four shillings per week, and content to drink water, so
he may diet at that price. But admit he hath a protection, yet it were worth
the while to deal with him till we see it. The truth is I much question his
pretended employment; for he hath here only showed the frame of a Common-weale
and some old sealed commissions, but no inside known. As for
Mr. Rigby if he be so honest, good and hopefull an instrument as report
passeth on him, he hath good hap to light on two of the arrantest known
knaves that ever trod on New English shore to be his agents east and west,
as Cleaves and Morton: but I shall be jealous on him till I know him better,
and hope others will take heed how they trust him who investeth such with
power who have devoted themselves to the ruin of the country, as Morton
hath. And for my part, (who if my heart deceive me not can pass by all the
evil instrumentally he brought on me,) would not have this serpent stay
amongst us, who out of doubt in time will get strength to him if he be suffered,
who promiseth large portions of land about New Haven, Narragansett, &amp;c.,
to all that will go with him, but hath a promise but of one person who is old,
weak and decrepid, a very atheist and fit companion for him. But, indeed,
Morton is the odium of our people at present, and if he be suffered, (for we
are diversely minded,) it will be just with God, who hath put him in our hands
and we will foster such an one, that afterward we shall suffer for it.”<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a></p></div>

<p>The Rigby referred to in this letter was Mr. Alexander
Rigby, an English gentleman of wealth who, besides being
a strong Puritan, was a member of the Long Parliament,
and at one time held a commission as colonel in the army.
Cleaves was the George Cleaves already mentioned as having
come out in 1637, with a protection under the privy signet.<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a>
He had then appeared as an agent of Gorges, but subse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>quently
he had got possession in Maine of the “Plough patent,”
so called, under which the title to a large part of the province
was claimed adversely to Gorges.<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> This patent Cleaves
induced Rigby to buy, and the latter was now endeavoring
to get his title recognized, and ultimately succeeded in so
doing. Cleaves, as well as Morton, enjoyed the reputation
of being “a firebrand of dissension,”<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> and the two had long
acted together. As Gorges had joined his fortunes to the
Royalist side, Morton clearly had nothing to gain by pretending
at Plymouth to be his agent or under his protection.
So he seems to have tried to pass himself off as a Commonwealth’s
man, commissioned by Rigby to act in his behalf.
Winslow was probably quite right in suspecting that this was
all a pretence. Rigby’s claim was for territory in Maine. It
is not known that he ever had any interests in Rhode Island
or Connecticut. There can, in short, be little doubt that
Morton was now nothing more than a poor, broken-down,
disreputable, old impostor, with some empty envelopes and
manufactured credentials in his pocket.</p>

<p>At Plymouth, as would naturally be supposed, Morton
made no headway. But the province of Maine was then in
an uneasy, troubled condition, and there was reported to be
a strong party for the king in the neighborhood of Casco
Bay. Thither accordingly Morton seems to have gone in
June, 1644.<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> His movements were closely watched, and Endicott
was notified that he would go by sea to Gloucester,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
hoping to get a passage from thence to the eastward. A
warrant for his arrest was at once despatched, but apparently
he eluded it; nor if he went there, which, indeed, is doubtful,
did Morton long remain in Maine. In August he was
in Rhode Island, and on the 5th of that month he is thus
alluded to in a letter from Coddington to <span class="lock">Winthrop:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“For Morton he was [insinuating] who was for the King at his first coming
to Portsmouth, and would report to such as he judged to be of his mind
he was glad [to meet with] so many cavaliers; ... and he had lands to
dispose of to his followers in each Province, and from Cape Ann to Cape Cod
was one.... And that he had wrong in the Bay [to the] value of two hundred
pounds, and made bitter complaints thereof. But Morton would let it
rest till the Governor came over to right him; and did intimate he knew
whose roast his spits and jacks turned.”<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a></p></div>

<p>Prospering in Rhode Island no more than at Plymouth,
Morton is next heard of as a prisoner in Boston. How he
came within the clutches of the Massachusetts magistrates is
not known; his necessities or his assurance may have carried
him to Boston, or he may have been pounced upon by Endicott’s
officers as he was furtively passing through the province.
In whatever way it came about, he was in custody on
the 9th of September, just five weeks from the time of Coddington’s
letter to Winthrop, and the latter then made the
following entry in his Journal:<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a>&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“At the court of assistants Thomas Morton was called forth presently after
the lecture, that the country might be satisfied of the justice of our proceeding
against him. There was laid to his charge his complaint against us at
the council board, which he denied. Then we produced the copy of the bill
exhibited by Sir Christopher Gardiner, etc., wherein we were charged with
treason, rebellion, etc., wherein he was named as a party or witness. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
denied that he had any hand in the information, only was called as a witness.
To convince him to be the principal party, it was showed: 1. That Gardiner
had no occasion to complain against us, for he was kindly used and dismissed
in peace, professing much engagement for the great courtesy he found here.
2. Morton had set forth a book against us, and had threatened us, and had
prosecuted a <i>quo warranto</i> against us, which he did not deny. 3. His letter
was produced,<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> written soon after to Mr. Jeffreys, his old acquaintance and
intimate friend.”</p></div>

<p>This passage is characteristic both of the man and of the
time. The prisoner now arraigned before the magistrates
had been set in the stocks, all his property had been confiscated,
and his house had been burned down before his eyes.
He had been sent back to England, under a warrant, to stand
his trial for crimes it was alleged he had committed. In
England he had been released from imprisonment in due
course of law. Having now returned to Massachusetts, he
was brought before the magistrates, “that the country might
be satisfied of the justice of our proceeding against him.”
As the result of this proceeding, which broke down for want
of proof, the alleged offender is again imprisoned, heavily
fined, and narrowly escapes a whipping. Under all these
circumstances, it becomes interesting to inquire what the
exact offence alleged against him was. It was stated by Winthrop.
He had made a “complaint against us at the council
board.”</p>

<p>“The council board” thus referred to was the royal Privy
Council. It represented the king, the supreme power in
the state, the source from whence the charter of the Massachu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>setts
Bay Company was derived. The complaint, therefore,
charged to have been made, was made to the common superior,
and it alleged the abuse, by an inferior, of certain powers
and privileges which that superior had granted. It would
seem to have been no easy task for the magistrates to point
out, either to the prisoner or to the country it was proposed
to satisfy, any prescriptive law, much less any penal statute,
which made a criminal offence out of a petition to the
acknowledged supreme power in the state, even though that
petition set forth the alleged abuse of charter privileges.</p>

<p>But it is not probable that this view of the matter ever
even suggested itself to Winthrop and his associates. It
does not seem even to have been urged upon them by the
prisoner. On the contrary he appears to have accepted the
inevitable, and practically admitted that a complaint to the
king was in Massachusetts, as Burdet had some years before
asserted, “accounted a perjury and treason in our general
courts,”<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> punishable at the discretion of the magistrates.
Morton, therefore, denied having made the complaint, and
the magistrates were unable to prove it against him. The
most singular and unaccountable feature in the proceedings
is that the <i>New Canaan</i> was not put in evidence. Apparently
there was no copy of it to be had. Could one have
been produced, it is scarcely possible that the avowed author
of the libellous strictures on Endicott, then himself governor,
should have escaped condign punishment of some sort from
a bench of Puritan magistrates. But Winthrop merely mentions
that he had “set forth a book against us,” and Mave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>rick
says that this was denied and could not be proved.<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> Had
a copy of the <i>New Canaan</i> then been at hand, either in
Boston or at Plymouth, a glance at the titlepage would have
proved who “set [it] forth” beyond possibility of denial.</p>

<p>The only entry in the Massachusetts records relating to
this proceeding is as <span class="lock">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“For answer to Thomas Morton petition, the magistrates have called him
publicly, and have laid divers things to his charge, which he denies; and
therefore they think fit that further evidence be sent for into England, and
that Mr Downing may have instructions to search out evidence against him,
and he to lie in prison in the mean time, unless he find sufficient bail.”<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a></p></div>

<p>This entry is from the records of the General Court, held
in November 1644. Among the unpublished documents in
the Massachusetts archives is yet another petition from Morton,
bearing no date, but, from the endorsement upon it, evidently
submitted to the General Court of May, 1645, six
months later, when Dudley was governor. This petition is as
<span class="lock">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

Merry-Mount company who had then “gone up into the inlands
to trade with the savages.”<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> During that summer he
experienced religion in a quite unexpected way, and now, in
1645, while his old master was rotting in the Boston jail, Gibbons
was a prosperous merchant, a deputy to the General
Court, and “chief military officer of the train-band of the
town.” Higher military honors and severe business vicissitudes
were in store for him. It nowhere appears whether
under these circumstances Major Gibbons had either the
will or the ability to be of service to his former chief, and
Winthrop is the only authority for what remains of Morton’s
story. It is soon told.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Having been kept in prison about a year in expectation of further evidence
out of England, he was again called before the court, and after some
debate what to do with him, he was fined 100 pounds, and set at liberty.
He was a charge to the country, for he had nothing, and we thought not
fit to inflict corporal punishment upon him, being old and crazy, but thought
better to fine him and give him his liberty, as if it had been to procure his
fine, but indeed to leave him opportunity to go out of the jurisdiction, as
he did soon after, and he went to Acomenticus, and living there poor and
despised, he died within two years after.”<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a></p></div>

<p>Morton himself asserted that the harsh treatment he
underwent in prison, while waiting for that evidence from
England which was to convict him of some crime, broke
down his health and hastened his end. If he was indeed,
as Maverick subsequently stated,<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> kept in jail and, as he
himself says, in irons, through an entire New England<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
winter, on the prison fare of those days, and without either
fire or bedding, this seems wholly probable.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There was about Thomas Morton nothing that was
remarkable. On the contrary he was one of a class of men
common enough in the days of Elizabeth and the Stuarts
to have found their way into the literature of the period, as
well as into that more modern romance which undertakes to
deal with it. It is the Alsatian Squire and Wildrake type.
Morton chanced to get out of place. He was a vulgar Royalist
libertine, thrown by accident into the midst of a Puritan
community. He was unable or unwilling to accept the
situation, or to take himself off; and hence followed his
misfortunes and his notoriety. Had he in 1625, or even in
1629, gone to Virginia or to New York, he would have lived
in quiet and probably died in poverty, leaving nothing
behind to indicate that he had ever been. As it is, he
will receive a mention in every history of America.</p>

<p>More recently also certain investigators, who have approached
the subject from a Church of England point of
view, have shown some disposition to adopt Morton’s cause
as their own, and to attribute his persecution, not to his
immoral life or illicit trade, but to his devotion to the Book
of Common Prayer.<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> It is another article in the long impeachment
of the founders of New England, and it has
even been alleged that “it still remains for Massachusetts to
do justice to Morton, who had his faults, though he was not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
the man his enemies, and notably Bradford, declared him
to be.”<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a></p>

<p>The <i>New English Canaan</i> is the best and only conclusive
evidence on this point. In its pages Morton very clearly
shows what he was, and the nature of “his faults.” He
was a born Bohemian, and as he passed on in life he became
an extremely reckless but highly amusing old debauchee and
tippler. When he was writing his book, Archbishop Laud
was the head of the board of Lords Commissioners. On
the action of that board depended all the author’s hopes.
In view of this fact, there are, in the <i>New Canaan</i>, few more
delightful or characteristic passages than that in which, describing
his arrest by Standish, Morton announces that it was
“because mine host was a man that endeavored to advance
the dignity of the Church of England; which they, on the
contrary part, would labor to vilify with uncivil terms; envying
against the sacred Book of Common Prayer, and mine
host that used it in a laudable manner amongst his family
as a practice of piety.”<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a></p>

<p>The part he was endeavoring to play when he wrote this
passage was one not very congenial to him, and he makes an
awkward piece of work of it. The sudden tone of sanctimony
which he infuses into the words quoted, hardly covers
up the leer and gusto with which he had just been describing
the drunkenness and debauchery of Merry-Mount,&mdash;how
“the good liquor” had flowed to all comers, while “the lasses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
in beaver-coats” had been welcome “night and day;” how
“he that played Proteus, with the help of Priapus, put their
noses out of joint;” and how that “barren doe” became fruitful,
who is mysteriously alluded to as a “goodly creature of
incontinency” who had “tried a camp royal in other parts.”
Though, from the point of view before alluded to, it has been
asserted that the Massachusetts magistrates “invented ... insinuations
respecting [Morton’s] treatment of [the Indian]
women, whom, in reality, he had fought to instruct in the
principles of religion,”<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a>&mdash;though this and other similar
assertions have been made with apparent gravity, yet it is
impossible to read the third book of the <i>New Canaan</i>, saturated
as it is with drunkenness, ribaldry and scoffing, without
coming to the conclusion that <i>Don Quixote</i>, <i>Rabelais</i>
and the <i>Decameron</i> are far more likely to have been in request
at Merry-Mount than the Bible or the Book of Common
Prayer.</p>

<p>Not that the <i>New Canaan</i> is in itself an obscene or even
a coarse book. On the contrary, judged by the standard of
its time, it is singularly the reverse. Indeed it is almost
wholly free from either word or allusion which would offend
the taste of the present day. Yet the writer of the <i>New
Canaan</i> was none the less a scoffer, a man of undevout
mind. As to the allegation that his devotion to the Church
of England and its ritual was the cause of his arrest by the
Plymouth authorities, the answer is obvious and decisive.
Blackstone was an Episcopalian, and a devout one, retaining
even in his wilderness home the canonical coat which told of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
his calling.<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> Maverick and Walford were Episcopalians;
they lived and died such. The settlers at Wessagusset were
Episcopalians. In the dwellings of all these the religious
services of the times, customary among Episcopalians, were
doubtless observed, for they were all religious men. Yet not
one of them was ever in any way molested by the Plymouth
people; but, on the contrary, they one and all received aid
and encouragement from Plymouth. Episcopalians as they
were, they all joined in dealing with Morton as a common
enemy and a public danger; and such he unquestionably
was. It was not, then, because he made use of the Common
Prayer that he was first driven from the Massachusetts Bay;
it was because he was a nuisance and a source of danger.
That subsequently, and by the Massachusetts authorities, he
was dealt with in a way at once high-handed and oppressive,
has been sufficiently shown in these pages. Yet it is by no
means clear that, under similar circumstances, he would not
have been far more severely and summarily dealt with at a
later period, when the dangers of a frontier life had brought
into use an unwritten code, which evinced even a less regard
for life than, in Morton’s case, the Puritans evinced for
property.<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a></p>

<p>As a literary performance the <i>New Canaan</i>, it is unneces<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>sary
to say, has survived through no merits of its own. While
it is, on the whole, a better written book than the <i>Wonder-Working
Providence</i>, it is not so well written as Wood’s
<i>Prospect</i>; and it cannot compare with what we have from the
pens of Smith or Gorges,&mdash;much less from those of Winslow,
Winthrop and, above all, Bradford. Indeed, it is
amazing how a man who knew as much as Morton knew of
events and places now full of interest, could have sat down
to write about them at all, and then, after writing so much,
have told so little. Rarely stating anything quite correctly,&mdash;the
most careless and slipshod of authors,&mdash;he took a
positive pleasure in concealing what he meant to say under
a cloud of metaphor. Accordingly, when printed, the <i>New
Canaan</i> fell still-born from the press, the only contemporaneous
trace of it which can be found in English literature
being Butler’s often quoted passage in <i>Hudibras</i>, in which
the Wessagusset hanging is alluded to.<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> It is even open to
question whether this reference was due to Butler’s having
read the book. The passage referred to is in the second
part of <i>Hudibras</i>, which was not published until 1664,
twenty-seven years after the publication of the <i>New Canaan</i>.
It is perfectly possible that Butler may have known Morton;
for in 1637 the future author of <i>Hudibras</i> was already
twenty-five years old, and Morton lingered about London
for six or seven years after that. There are indications that
he knew Ben Jonson;<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> and, indeed, it is scarcely possible that
with his sense of humor and convivial tastes Morton should
not often have met the poets and playwrights of the day at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
the Mermaid. If he and the author of <i>Hudibras</i> ever did
chance to meet, they must have proved congenial spirits, for
there is much that is Hudibrastic in the <i>New Canaan</i>. Not
impossibly, therefore, the idea of a vicarious New England
hanging dwelt for years in the brain of Butler, not as the
reminiscence of a passage he had read in some forgotten
book, but as a vague recollection of an amusing story which
he had once heard Morton tell.</p>

<p>It is, indeed, the author’s sense of humor, just alluded to,
which gives to the <i>New Canaan</i> its only real distinction
among the early works relating to New England. In this
respect it stands by itself. In all the rest of those works, one
often meets with passages of simplicity, of pathos and of
great descriptive power,&mdash;never with anything which was
both meant to raise a smile, and does it. The writers seemed
to have no sense of humor, no perception of the ludicrous.
Bradford, for instance, as a passage “rather of mirth than
of weight,” describes how he put a stop to the Christmas
games at Plymouth in 1621. There is a grim solemnity in
his very chuckle. Winthrop gives a long account of the
penance of Captain John Underhill, as he stood upon a stool
in the church, “without a band, in a foul linen cap pulled
close to his eyes,” and “blubbering,” confessed his adultery
with the cooper’s wife.<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> Yet he evidently recorded it with
unbroken gravity. Then, in 1644, he mentions that “two of
our ministers’ sons, being students in the college, robbed two
dwelling-houses, in the night, of some 15 pounds. Being
found out, they were ordered by the governors of the col<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>lege
to be there whipped, which was performed by the
president himself&mdash;yet they were about twenty years of
age.”<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> If Morton had recorded this incident, he could not
have helped seeing a ludicrous side to it, and he would have
expressed it in some humorous, or at least in some grotesque
way. Winthrop saw the serious side of everything, and the
serious side only. In this he was like all the rest. Such
solemnity, such everlasting consciousness of responsibility to
God and man, is grand and perhaps impressive; but it
grows wearisome. It is pleasant to have it broken at last,
even though that which breaks it is in some respects not
to be commended. A touch of ribaldry becomes bearable.
Among what are called <i>Americana</i>, therefore, the <i>New
Canaan</i> is and will always remain a refreshing book. It is
a connecting link. Poor as it may be, it is yet all we have
to remind us that in literature, also, Bradford and Winthrop
and Cotton were Englishmen of the time of Shakespeare and
Jonson and Butler.</p>

<p>It remains only to speak of the bibliography of the <i>New
Canaan</i>, which at one time excited some discussion, and of
the present edition. Written before the close of 1635, the
<i>New Canaan</i> was printed at Amsterdam in 1637. It has
been reprinted but once,&mdash;by Force, in the second volume of
his <i>American Tracts</i>. The present is, therefore, the second
reprint, and the first annotated edition. For a number of
years it was supposed that copies of the book were in existence
with an alternative titlepage, bearing the imprint of
Charles Greene, and the date of 1632.<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> This supposition
was, however, very carefully examined into by Mr. Winsor
in the <i>Harvard University Literary Bulletins</i> (Nos. 9 and 10,
1878-9, pp. 196, 244), and found to be partially, at least,
groundless. It was due to the fact that Force made his
reprint from a copy of the book in his collection, now in the
Library of Congress. That copy lacked a portion or the
whole of the titlepage; and the missing parts seem to have
been supplied, without mention of the fact being made, from
the entry of the book under 1632 in White Kennet’s <i>Bibliothecæ
Americanæ Primordia</i>. Apparently the error originated
in the following way. The <i>New Canaan</i> was entered
for copyright in the Stationers’ Registers in London,
November 18, 1633, in behalf of Charles Greene, the printer.
There is no reason to suppose that it was then com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>pleted,
as it may have been entered by its title alone. If it
was, however, completed in part in 1633, the internal evidence
is conclusive that it was both revised<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> and added to<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a>
as late as 1634; and, indeed, the Board of Lords Commissioners
for regulating Plantations, to which it is formally
dedicated, was not created until April 10th of that year.
Greene did not print the book; though, as will presently
be seen, a certain number of copies may possibly have been
struck off for him with titlepages of their own. The entry
in the Stationers’ Registers was, however, afterwards discovered,
and seems then to have supplied by inference the
date of publication, which could not be learned from certain
copies, the titlepages to which were defective or wanting.
The dates given in Lowndes’s <i>Manual</i> would seem to
be simply incorrect.<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> Meanwhile, for reasons probably of
economy, though notice of publication had been given in
London, the book was actually printed in Holland, and the
regular titlepage reads: “Printed at Amsterdam by Jacob
Frederick Stam, in the year 1637.” There are copies, however,
the titlepages of which read: “Printed for Charles
Greene, and are sold in Pauls Churchyard,” no date being
given.<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> It is not known that these copies differ in any other
respect from those bearing the usual imprint. The conclusion,
therefore, would seem to be that, as already stated, a
number of copies may have been struck off for Greene
with a distinct titlepage. Properly speaking, however, there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
seems to have been but one edition of the book. With the
exception of the Force titlepage, which has been shown
to be erroneous, there is no evidence of any copy being
in existence bearing an earlier date than the usual one of
Amsterdam, 1637.</p>

<p>Copies of the <i>New Canaan</i> are extremely rare. Savage,
in his notes to Winthrop (vol. i. p. *34), said that he had
then, before 1825, never heard of but one copy, “which was
owned by his Excellency John Q. Adams.” It is from that
copy that the present edition is printed. Mr. Adams purchased
it while in Europe prior to the year 1801. It was
that copy also which was temporarily deposited in the Boston
Athenæum in 1810, as mentioned in the <i>Monthly Anthology</i>
of that date (vol. viii. p. 420), referred to in the <i>Harvard
University Library Bulletin</i>, (No. 9, p. 196). The Rev.
George Whitney, in his <i>History of Quincy</i> written in 1826,
says (p. 11) that another “copy was lately presented to the
Adams Library of the town of Quincy by the Rev. Thaddeus
Mason Harris.”<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> In addition to these, some dozen or twenty
other copies in all are known to exist in various public and
private collections in America and Europe, several of which
are enumerated in the <i>Literary Bulletin</i> just referred to.</p>

<p>Very many of the errors both in typography and punctuation,
with which the <i>New Canaan</i> abounds, are obviously due
to the fact that it was printed in Amsterdam. The original
manuscript it would seem was no more legible than the manu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>script
of that period, as it has come down to us, is usually
found to be. At best it was not easy to decipher. The
copy of the <i>New Canaan</i> was then put in the hands of a
compositor imperfectly, if at all, acquainted with English;
and, if the proof-sheets were ever corrected by any one, they
certainly were not corrected by the author or by a proof-reader
really familiar with his writing, or even with the
tongue in which he wrote. Accordingly pen flourishes were
mistaken for punctuation marks, and these were inserted
without any regard to the context; familiar words appeared
in unintelligible shapes;<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> small letters were mistaken for capitals,
and capitals for small letters, and one letter was confounded
with another. In addition to these numerous mistakes
in deciphering and following the manuscript, ordinary
typographical errors are not uncommon; though in this
respect the <i>New Canaan</i> is less marked by blemishes than
under the circumstances would naturally be supposed.</p>

<p>Neither is this explanation of the curiously bad press-work
of the <i>New Canaan</i> a mere conjecture. One other
composition of Morton’s has come down to us in the letter
to Jeffreys, preserved by Winthrop.<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> Let any one compare
this letter with a chapter from the <i>New Canaan</i>, and he will
see at once that, while both are manifestly productions from
the same pen, they have been preserved under wholly different
circumstances. Take, for instance, the following identical
passages,&mdash;the one from the <i>New Canaan</i> and the other
from the letter to Jeffreys, and they will sufficiently illustrate
this point.</p>

<p>The letter to Jeffreys is curiously characteristic of Morton.
It is written in the same inflated, metaphorical, enigmatic
style as the <i>New Canaan</i>. It is, however, perfectly intelligible
and even energetic. The reason is obvious. It was correctly
copied by a man who understood what the writer was
saying. Accordingly it is as clear as Winthrop’s own text.
The <i>New Canaan</i> would have been equally clear had it been
deciphered at the compositor’s form by a man with Winthrop’s
familiarity with English.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There is some reason to think that the fancy for exact
reproduction in typography has of late years been carried to
an extreme. Not only have peculiarities of spelling, capitalization
and type, which were really characteristic of the past,
been carefully followed, but abbreviations and figures have
been reproduced in type, which formerly were confined to
manuscripts, and are certainly never found in the better
printed books of the same period. It is certainly desirable in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
reprinting quaint works, which it is not supposed will ever
pass into the hands of general readers, to have them appear
in the dress of the time to which they belong. Indeed they
cannot be modernized in spelling, the use of capitals, or
even, altogether, in punctuation, without losing something
of their flavor. Yet, this notwithstanding, there is no good
reason why gross and manifest blunders, due to the ignorance
of compositors and the carelessness of proof-readers,
should be jealously perpetuated as if they were sacred things.
This assuredly is carrying the spirit of faithful reproduction
to fanaticism. It is Chinese.</p>

<p>The rule followed, therefore, in the present edition has
been to reproduce the <i>New Canaan</i> as it appeared in the
Amsterdam edition of 1637, correcting only the punctuation,
and such errors of the press as are manifest and unmistakable.
Very few changes have been made in the use of capitals,
and those only where it is obvious that a letter of one
kind in the copy was mistaken by the compositor for a letter
of another kind. An example of this is found at the top of
page *14, where “Captaine Davis’ fate,” in the author’s
manuscript, is made to appear as “Captain Davis Fate,” in
the original text. The compositor evidently mistook the
small <i>f</i>, written with the old-fashioned flourish, for an initial
capital. The spelling has in no case been changed except
where the error, as in the case already cited of “muit” for
“mint,” is manifestly due to printers’ blunders. Mistakes of
the press, such as “legg” for “logg” (p. *77) and “vies” for
“eies” (p. *152), have been made right wherever they could
be certainly detected.</p>

<p>No conjectural readings whatever have been inserted in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
the text. The few passages, not more than four or five in
number, in which, owing probably to the failure of the compositor
to decipher manuscript, the meaning of the original
is not clear, are reproduced exactly. No liberties whatever
have been taken with the original edition in these cases, and
all guesses which are indulged in as to the author’s meaning,
whether by the editor or others, are confined to the
notes. In a few places the text is obviously deficient.
Words necessary to the meaning are omitted in printing.
Wherever these have been conjecturally inserted, the inserted
words are in brackets. In a very few cases, words, which
could clearly have found their way into the original only
through inadvertence, have been omitted. Attention is
called in the notes to every such omission.</p>

<p>The effort in the present edition has, in short, been to
make it a reproduction of the <i>New Canaan</i>; but the reproduction

have therefore beene willing to doe my indevoure to communicat

For the better information of all such as are desirous to be

Soyle, as well as those <span class="originpage"><a id="OPage_8">{8}</a></span> that, out of Curiosity onely, have

private ends, have laboured to keepe both the practise of the
people there, and the Reall worth of that eminent Country
concealed from publike knowledge; both which I have
abundantly in this discourse layd open: yet if it be well

<div class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">Th</span>e wise Creator of the universall Globe
hath placed a golden meane betwixt two extreames;
I meane the temperate Zones, betwixt
the hote and cold; and every Creature, that
participates of Heavens blessings with in
the Compasse of that golden meane, is made most <span class="originpage"><a id="OPage_12">{12}</a></span> apt
and fit for man to use, who likewise by that wisedome is
ordained to be the Lord of all. This globe may be his glasse,
to teach him how to use moderation and discretion, both in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
his actions and intentions. The wise man sayes, give mee
neither riches nor poverty; why? Riches might make him
proud like Nebuchadnezar, and poverty despaire like Iobs
wife; but a meane betweene both.

<span class="sidenote"><i>Vse of vegetatives.</i></span>

So it is likewise in the
use of Vegetatives, that which hath too much Heate or too
much Colde, is said to be venenum: so in the use of sensitives,
all those Animals, of what genus or species soever they
be, if they participate of heate or cold in the superlative are
said to be <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Inimica naturæ</i>, as in some Fishes about the Isle
of Sall, and those Ilandes adjoyninge between the Tropickes;

<span class="sidenote"><i>Fish poysonous
about the Isle
of Sall.</i></span>

their participatinge of heate and cold, in the superlative, is
made most manifest, one of which poysoned a whole Ships
company that eate of it.<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> And so it is in Vipers, Toades, and
Snakes, that have heate or cold in the superlative degree.</div>


<div>Therefore the Creatures that participate of heate and cold
in a meane, are best and holsomest: And so it is in the choyse
of love, the middell Zone betweene the two extreames is best,

<span class="sidenote"><i>Zona temperata,
the Golden
meane.</i></span>

and it is therefore called <i>Zona temperata</i>, and is in the
golden meane; and all those landes lying under that Zone,
most requisite and fitt for habitation. In Cosmography, the
two extreames are called, the one <i>Torrida Zona</i>, lying be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>tweene
the Tropickes, the other <i>Frigida Zona</i>, lying neare
the poles: all the landes lying under either of these
Zones, by reason they doe participate too <span class="originpage"><a id="OPage_13">{13}</a></span> much of
heate or cold, are very inconvenient, and are accompanied
with many evils. And allthough I am not of opinion
with Aristotle,<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> that the landes under <i>Torrida Zona</i> are
alltogether uninhabited, I my selfe having beene so neare
the equinoctiall line that I have had the Sunn for my Zenith
and seene proofe to the contrary, yet cannot I deny but that
it is accompanied with many inconveniences, as that Fish
and Flesh both will taint in those partes, notwithstanding
the use of Salt which cannot be wanting there, ordained by
natures hande-worke;


<span class="sidenote"><i>Salt aboundeth
under the
Tropicks.</i></span>

And that is a great hinderance to the
settinge forth and supply of navigation, the very Sinewes of
a florishing Commonwealth. Then barrennesse, caused
through want of raines, for in most of those partes of the
world it is seldome accustomed to raine untill the time of the
Tornathees (as the Portingals<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> phrase is, who lived there) and


<span class="sidenote"><i>Raine 40.
dayes about August
betweene
Cancer and the
Line.</i></span>

then it will raine about 40. dayes together, which moisture
serveth to fructify the earth for all the yeare after, duringe
which time is seene no raine at all: the heate and cold, and
length of day and night, being much alike, with little difference.
And these raines are caused by the turning of the
windes, which else betweene the Tropickes doe blow Trade,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
that is allwayes one way. For next the Tropicke of Cancer
it is constantly North-East, and next the Tropicke of Capricorne
it is Southwest; so that the windes comming from the
Poles, do keepe the aire in those partes coole, and make it
temperate and the partes habitable, were it not for those and
other inconveniences.</div>

<p><span class="originpage"><a id="OPage_14">{14}</a></span> This <i>Torrida Zona</i> is good for Grashoppers: and
<i>Zona Temperata</i> for the Ant and Bee. But <i>Frigida
Zona</i> [is] good for neither, as by lamentable experience of



<span class="sidenote"><i>Capt. Davis

Captaine Davis fate is manifest, who in his inquest of the
Northwest passage for the East India trade was frozen to
death.<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> And therefore, for <i>Frigida Zona</i>, I agree with Aristotle
that it is unfit for habitation:<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> and I know by the
Course of the cælestiall globe that in Groeneland, many Degrees



<span class="sidenote"><i>Groene Land
too cold for
habitation.</i></span>


short of the Pole Articke, the place is too cold, by
reason of the Sunns absence almost six monethes, and the
land under the continuall power of the frost; which thinge
many more Navigators have prooved with pittifull experience
of their wintringe there, as appeareth by the history.
I thinke they will not venture to winter there againe for an
India mine.</p>

<p>And as it is found by our Nation under the Pole Articke,
so it is likewise to be found under the Antarticke Pole; yet
what hazard will not an industrious minde and couragious

whether a foole or a wise man shall enjoy it. Therefore let
us leave these two extreames, with their inconveniences, and
indeavour to finde out this golden meane, so free from any
one of them. Behold the secret wisedome of allmighty
God, and love unto our Salomon, to raise a man of a lardge
hart, full of worthy abilities, to be the Index or
Loadstarre, that doth point out <span class="originpage"><a id="OPage_15">{15}</a></span> unto the English

And this the noble minded Gentleman, Sir Ferdinando
Gorges,<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> Knight, zealous for the glory of God, the honor of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
his Majesty and the benefit of the weale publicke, hath done
a great worke for the good of his Country.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The Salvages
dyed of the

<p>And herein this, the wondrous wisedome and love of God,
is shewne, by sending to the place his Minister, to sweepe
away by heapes the Salvages; and also giving him length
of dayes to see the same performed after his enterprise was
begunne, for the propagation of the Church of Christ.</p>

<p>This judicious Gentleman hath found this goulden meane
to be scituated about the middle of those two extreames,
and for directions you may proove it thus: Counting the
space betweene the Line and either of the Poles, in true
proportion, you shall finde it to be 90. Degrees: then must
we finde the meane to be neare unto the Center of 90. and
that is about 45. Degrees, and then incline unto the Sotherne
side of that Center, properly for the benefit of heate,
remembringe that <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sol &amp; Homo generàt hominem</i>; and then
keepe us on that same side, and see what Land is to be found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
there, and we shall easily discerne that new England is on
the South side of that Center.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>New Engl. is

<p>For that Country doth beginne her boundes at 40. Degrees
of Northerne latitude, and endes at 45. Degrees of the same

for the generation and habitation of our English nation, of
all other, who are more neere neighbours to the Northerne

nearer to the line then that old England by 10. Degrees
of latitude, yet doth not this exceede that other in heate
or cold, by reason of the cituation of it; for as the Coast
lyeth, being circularly Northeast and Southwest, opposite
towards the Sunnes risinge, which makes his course over the
Ocean, it can have litle or no reflecting heat of the Sun-beames,
by reason of the continuall motion of the waters
makinge the aire there the cooler and the constanter; so
that for the temperature of the Climent, sweetnesse of the
aire, fertility of the Soile, and small number of the Salvages
(which might seeme a rubb in the way off an effeminate
minde,) this Country of new England is by all judicious
men accounted the principall part of all America for habitation
and the commodiousnesse of the Sea, Ships there not
being subject to wormes as in Virginea and other places,
and not to be paraleld in all Christendome.

<p>In the yeare since the incarnation of Christ, 1622, it was
my chance to be landed in the parts of New England,<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a>
where I found two sortes of people, the one Christians, the
other Infidels; these I found most full of humanity, and
more friendly then the other: as shall hereafter be made
apparant in Dew-Course by their severall actions from time
to time, whilest I lived among them. After my arrivall
in those partes, I endeavoured by all the wayes and meanes
that I could to find out from what people, or nation,
the Natives of <span class="originpage"><a id="OPage_18">{18}</a></span> New England might be conjectured
originlly to proceede; and by continuance and conversation
amongst them, I attaned to so much of their language,
as by all probable conjecture may make the same manifest:
for it hath been found by divers, and those of good
judgement, that the Natives of this Country doe use very
many wordes, both of Greeke and Latine, to the same signification


<span class="sidenote"><i>The Natives

that the Latins and Greekes have done; as <i>en animia</i>,<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a>

the greedinesse of his minde and much eating, for <i>Pasco</i> in

and <i>Pasco nantum,<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a> quasi pasco nondum</i>, halfe starved, or not

reverence and estimation, and it may bee have worshipped
<i>Pan</i> the great God of the Heathens: Howsoever they doe
use no manner of worship at all now: and it is most likely
that the Natives of this Country are descended from people
bred upon that part of the world which is towardes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
<span class="originpage"><a id="OPage_19">{19}</a></span> the Tropicke of Cancer, for they doe still retaine the
memory of some of the Starres one that part of the
Cælestiall Globe, as the North-starre, which with them is
called Maske,<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a> for Maske in their Language signifieth a

<p>And whereas it hath beene the opinion of some men,
which shall be nameles, that the Natives of New-England
may proceede from the race of the Tartars, and come from
Tartaria into those partes,<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> over the frozen Sea, I see no


<span class="sidenote"><i>Not to proceede

probality for any such Conjecture; for as much as a people
once setled must be remooved by compulsion, or else tempted
thereunto in hope of better fortunes, upon commendations
of the place unto which they should be drawne to remoove:
and if it may be thought that these people came over the
frozen Sea, then would it be by compulsion? if so, then by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
whome, or when? or what part of this mane continent may



<span class="sidenote"><i>No part of

be thought to border upon the Country of the Tartars, it is
yet unknowne: and it is not like, that a people well enough
at ease will of their one accord undertake to travayle over
a Sea of Ice, considering how many difficulties they shall
encounter with; as first, whether there be any Land at the
end of their unknowne way, no Land beinge in view; then
want of Food to sustane life in the meane time upon
that Sea of Ice; or <span class="originpage"><a id="OPage_20">{20}</a></span> how should they doe for Fuell,
to keepe them at night from freezing to death, which
will not bee had in such a place. But it may perhaps be
granted that the Natives of this Country might originally
come of the scattred Trojans: For after that Brutus, who



<span class="sidenote"><i>Why Brutus
left Latium.</i></span>

was the forth from Aneas, left Latium upon the conflict
had with the Latines, (where although hee gave them a
great overthrow, to the Slaughter of their grand Captaine
and many other of the Heroes of Latium, yet hee held it
more safety to depart unto some other place and people,
then by staying to runne the hazard of an unquiet life or
doubtfull Conquest, which as history maketh mention hee
performed,) this people were dispersed: there is no question
but the people that lived with him, by reason of their
conversation with the Græcians and Latines, had a mixed
language that participated of both, whatsoever was that
which was proper to their owne nation at first I know not:
for this is commonly seene where 2. nations traffique together,
the one indevouring to understand the others meaning
makes them both many times speak a mixed language,



<span class="sidenote"><i>Two nations
meetinge make

as is approoved by the Natives of New England, through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
the coveteous desire they have to commerce with our nation
and wee with them.</p>

<p>And when Brutus did depart from Latium, we doe not
finde that his whole number went with him at once, or
arrived at one place; and being put to Sea might encounter
with a storme that would carry them out of sight of Land,
and then they might sayle God knoweth whether, and
so might be put upon this <span class="originpage"><a id="OPage_21">{21}</a></span> Coast, as well as any
other. Compasse I beleeve they had none in those
dayes; Sayles they might have, (which Dædalus the first



<span class="sidenote"><i>Dædalus the

inventor thereof left to after ages, having taught his Sonne



<span class="sidenote"><i>Icarus the second

Sayles.</i></span>

Icarus the use of it, who to this Cost found how dangerous it
is for a Sonne not to observe the precepts of a wise Father,
so that the Icarian Sea now retaines the memory of it to this
day,) and Victuals they might have good store, and many
other things fittinge; oares without all question they would
store themselves with, in such a case; but for the use of
Compasse, there is no mention made of it at that time
(which was much about Sauls time, the first that was made



<span class="sidenote"><i>Troy destroyed
about Sauls
time.</i></span>

King of Israell.) Yet it is thought (and that not without
good reason for it) that the use of the Loadstone and Compasse
was knowne in Salomons time, for as much as hee sent



<span class="sidenote"><i>The Loadstone
in Salomons
time.</i></span>

Shippes to fetch of the gould of Ophir, to adorne and bewtify
that magnificent Temple of Hierusalem by him built for the
glory of Almighty God, and by his speciall appointment:
and it is held by Cosmographers to be 3. yeares voyage
from Hierusalem to Ophir, and it is conceaved that such a
voyage could not have beene performed, without the helpe
of the Loadstone and Compasse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span></p>

<p>And why should any man thinke the Natives of New
England to be the gleanings of all Nations, onely because
by the pronunciation and termination their words seeme to
trench upon severall languages, when time hath not furnished
him with the interpretation thereof. The thinge
that must induce a man of reasonable capacity to any
maner of conjecture of <span class="originpage"><a id="OPage_22">{22}</a></span> their originall, must be the
sence and signification of the words, principally to
frame this argument by, when hee shall drawe to any conclusion
thereupon: otherwise hee shall but runne rounde about
a maze (as some of the fantasticall tribe use to do about the
tythe of mint<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> and comin.) Therefore, since I have had
the approbation of Sir Christopher Gardiner,<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> Knight, an

people, both Scollers and Travellers that were diligent in
taking notice of these things, as men of good judgement,
and that have bin in those parts any time, besides others of
lesse, now I am bold to conclude that the originall of the
Natives of New England may be well conjectured to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
from the scattered Trojans, after such time as Brutus departed

<p>The Natives of New England are accustomed to build
them houses much like the wild Irish; they gather
Poles in the woodes and put the great end of them in the
ground, placinge them in forme of a circle or circumference,
and, bendinge the topps of them in forme of an Arch, they
bind them together with the Barke of Walnut trees, which
is wondrous tuffe, so that they make the same round

and passe through; these they cover with matts, some
made of reeds and some of longe flagges, or sedge, finely
sowed together with needles made of the splinter bones of a
Cranes legge, with threeds made of their Indian hempe,
which their groueth naturally, leaving severall places for
dores, which are covered with mats, which may be rowled up
and let downe againe at their pleasures, making use of the
severall dores, according as the winde sitts.<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> The fire is
alwayes made in the middest of the house, with winde fals
commonly: yet some times they fell a tree that groweth
neere the house, and, by drawing in the end thereof, maintaine
the fire on both sids, burning the tree by Degrees
shorter and shorter, untill it be all consumed; for it burneth
night and day. Their lodging is made in three places of
the house about the fire; they lye upon plankes, commonly
about a foote or 18. inches aboue the ground, raised upon
railes that are borne up upon forks; they lay mats under
them, and Coats of Deares skinnes, otters, beavers, Ra<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>cownes,
and of Beares hides, all which they have dressed

Nay, if any one that shall come into their <span class="originpage"><a id="OPage_26">{26}</a></span> houses and
there fall a sleepe, when they see him disposed to lye
downe, they will spreade a matt for him of their owne accord,
and lay a roule of skinnes for a boulster, and let him lye. If
hee sleepe untill their meate be dished up, they will set a
wooden boule of meate by him that sleepeth, and wake him

<p>Likewise, when they are minded to remoove, they carry
away the mats with them; other materiales the place adjoyning
will yeald. They use not to winter and summer in one
place, for that would be a reason to make fuell scarse; but,
after the manner of the gentry of Civilized natives, remoove
for their pleasures; some times to their hunting places, where
they remaine keeping good hospitality for that season; and
sometimes to their fishing places, where they abide for that
season likewise: and at the spring, when fish comes in plentifully,
they have meetinges from severall places, where they
exercise themselves in gaminge and playing of juglinge
trickes and all manner of Revelles, which they are deligted

there is no people so barbarous but have some worshipp
or other. In this particular, I am not of opinion therein
with Tully; and, surely, if hee had bin amongst those people
so longe as I have bin, and conversed so much with them
touching this matter of Religion, hee would have changed
his opinion. Neither should we have found this error,
amongst the rest, by the helpe of that wodden prospect,<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> if it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>

that Coast (all mens judgements in generall,) doth not yeeld,
had hee but taken the judiciall councell of Sir William
Alexander, that setts this thing forth in an exact and conclusive
sentence; if hee be not too obstinate? hee would
graunt that worthy writer, that these people are <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sine fide, sine

a familiar demonstration, which I have by longe experience
observed to be true.</p>

<p>And, me thinks, it is absurd to say they have a kinde of
worship, and not able to demonstrate whome or what it is
they are accustomed to worship. For my part I am more
willing to beleeve that the Elephants (which are reported to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>

England have no worship nor religion at all; and I am sure
it has been so observed by those that neede not the helpe of

<p>These skinnes they convert into very good lether, making

dresse with the haire on, and some with the haire off; the
hairy side in winter time they weare next their bodies, and
in warme weather they weare the haire outwardes: they
make likewise some Coates of the Feathers of Turkies,
which they weave together with twine of their owne makinge,
very prittily: these garments they weare like mantels

<span class="sidenote"><i>Indians ingenious

wherein they strive to excell one another: And Mantels
made of Beares skinnes is an usuall wearinge, among the
Natives that live where the Beares doe haunt: they make
shooes of Mose skinnes, which is the principall leather used
to that purpose; and for want of such lether (which is the
strongest) they make shooes of Deeres skinnes, very handsomly
and commodious; and, of such deeres skinnes as they

wee call by the names of Powahs: some correspondency
they have with the Devil out of al doubt, as by some of
their accions, in which they glory, is manifested. Papasiquineo,<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a>
that Sachem or Sagamore, is a Powah of greate estimation
amongst all kinde of Salvages there: hee is at their
Revels (which is the time when a great company of Salvages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
meete from severall parts of the Country, in amity with their
neighbours) hath advaunced his honor in his feats or jugling
tricks (as I may right tearme them) to the admiration of the
spectators, whome hee endevoured to perswade that he would
goe under water to the further side of a river, to broade for
any man to undertake with a breath, which thing hee performed
by swimming over, and deluding the company with
casting a mist before their eies that see him enter in and
come out, but no part of the way hee has bin seene: likewise
by our English, in the heat of all summer to make Ice
appeare in a bowle of faire water; first, having the water set
before him, hee hath begunne his incantation according to
their usuall accustome, and before the same has bin
ended a thick Clowde has darkned the <span class="originpage"><a id="OPage_35">{35}</a></span> aire and, on a

the vulgar people, which doubtles was done by the agility
of Satan, his consort.</p>

<p>And by meanes of these sleights, and such like trivial
things as these, they gaine such estimation amongst the rest
of the Salvages that it is thought a very impious matter for
any man to derogate from the words of these Powahs. In
so much as hee that should slight them, is thought to commit

answerable to his Masteers expectation, but being called to an

made answer that he had given that coate to Tantoquineo, a
Powah: to which his master in a rage cryed, what have I to

matter, cryed, what you speake? you are not a very good
man; wil you not give Tantoq. a coat? whats this? as

not with his reputation to make himself or his men so servile,
to fetch her againe. The old Sachem Papasiquineo, having
this message returned, was inraged to think that his young
son in law did not esteeme him at a higher rate then to
capitulate with him about the matter, and returne[d] him
this sharpe reply; that his daughters bloud and birth deserved
more respect then to be so slighted; and, therefore,
if he would have her company, hee were best to send or
come for her.</p>

<p><span class="originpage"><a id="OPage_40">{40}</a></span> The younge Sachem, not willing to under value
himselfe and being a man of a stout spirit, did not
stick to say that hee should either send her by his owne
Convey, or keepe her; for hee was determined not<a name="FNanchor_259_259" id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a> to stoope
so lowe.</p>

<p>So much these two Sachems stood upon tearmes of reputation
with each other, the one would not send her, and the
other would not send for her, least it should be any diminishing
of honor on his part that should seeme to comply, that
the Lady (when I came out of the Country) remained still
with her father; which is a thinge worth the noting, that
Salvage people should seeke to maintaine their reputation so

<p>When they went a hunting for turkies they spreade over
such a greate scope of ground that a Turkie could hardily
escape them: Deare they killed up in greate abundance, and

Yea, sometimes (like genious fellowes) they would present

<p>But the Sachem Cheecatawbak, (on whose possessions they

owne use, contrary to his likeing,) not being of power to
resist them, practised to doe it by a subtile stratagem.



<span class="sidenote"><i>A subtile plot of a Sachem.</i></span>

And to that end <span class="originpage"><a id="OPage_45">{45}</a></span> gave it out amongst us, that the
cause why these other Salvages of the Narohigansets
came into these parts, was to see what strength we were of,
and to watch an opportunity to cut us off, and take that
which they found in our custody usefull for them; And
added further, they would burne our howses, and that they
had caught one of his men, named Meshebro, and compelled
him to discover to them where their barnes, Magazines, or
storehowses were, and had taken away his corne; and seemed
to be in a pittifull perplexity about the matter.</p>

<p>And, the more to adde reputation to this tale, desires
that his wifes and children might be harbered in one of our
howses. This was graunted; and my neighbours put on
corslets, headpeeces, and weapons defensive and offensive.</p>

<p>This thing being knowne to Cheecatawback, hee caused
some of his men to bring the Narohigansets to trade, that
they might see the preparation. The Salvage, that was
a stranger to the plott, simply comming to trade, and findding
his merchants lookes like lobsters, all cladd in harnesse,
was in a maze to thinke what would be the end of it.
Haste hee made to trade away his furres, and tooke anything
for them, wishing himselfe well rid of them and of the company
in the howse.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>A Salvage

and asked his <span class="originpage"><a id="OPage_46">{46}</a></span> giude whether the company were not
angry. The guide, (that was privy to his Lords plot)
answered in his language that hee could not tell. But the
harmelesse Salvage, before hee had halfe filled his belly,
started up on a sodayne, and ranne out of the howse in such
hast that hee left his furmety there, and stayed not to looke
behinde him who came after: Glad hee was that he had
escaped so.</p>

a feare of being surprised; and sent to see whether the enemies
(as the Messenger termed them) were not in the howse;

stopps the chinkes of the out howse, for feare the fire might
be seene in the night, and be a meanes to direct his enemies
where to finde them.</p>

seene <span class="originpage"><a id="OPage_48">{48}</a></span> soener by one hower, yea, two howers sayle,

this particular so much noted, so I thinke they excell us in
all the rest.</p>


<p>This I am sure I have well observed, that in the sence of
smelling they have very great perfection; which is confirmed
by the opinion of the French that are planted about Canada,
who have made relation that they are so perfect in the
use of that sence, that they will distinguish between a Spaniard

<p>I have seene a Deare passe by me upon a neck of Land,
and a Salvage that has pursued him by the view. I have
accompanied him in this pursuite; and the Salvage, pricking
the Deare, comes where hee findes the view of two deares

together, leading several wayes. One, hee was sure, was
fresh, but which (by the sence of seeing) hee could not judge;
therefore, with his knife, hee diggs up the earth of one; and,
by smelling, sayes, that was not of the fresh Deare: then
diggs hee up the other; and viewing and smelling to that,
concludes it to be the view of the fresh Deare, which hee
had pursued; and thereby followes the chase, and
killes that <span class="originpage"><a id="OPage_49">{49}</a></span> Deare, and I did eate part of it with him:

<p>The Salvages are accustomed to set fire of the Country
in all places where they come, and to burne it twize
a yeare, viz: at the Spring, and the fall of the leafe. The
reason that mooves them to doe so, is because it would

other wise be so overgrowne with underweedes that it would
be all a coppice wood, and the people would not be able
in any wise to passe through the Country out of a beaten
path.</p>

<p>The meanes that they do it with, is with certaine minerall
stones, that they carry about them in baggs made for that
purpose of the skinnes of little beastes, which they convert
into good lether, carrying in the same a peece of
touch wood, very excellent <span class="originpage"><a id="OPage_53">{53}</a></span> for that purpose, of their
owne making.<a name="FNanchor_280_280" id="FNanchor_280_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a> These minerall stones they have from
the Piquenteenes, (which is to the Southward of all the
plantations in New England,) by trade and trafficke with
those people.</p>

<p>The burning of the grasse destroyes the underwoods, and
so scorcheth the elder trees that it shrinkes them, and hinders
their grouth very much: so that hee that will looke to
finde large trees and good tymber, must not depend upon
the help of a woodden prospect to finde them on the upland<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
ground;<a name="FNanchor_281_281" id="FNanchor_281_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a> but must seeke for them, (as I and others have
done,) in the lower grounds, where the grounds are wett,
when the Country is fired, by reason of the snow water that
remaines there for a time, untill the Sunne by continuance
of that hath exhaled the vapoures of the earth, and dried up
those places where the fire, (by reason of the moisture,) can
have no power to doe them any hurt: and if he would
endevoure to finde out any goodly Cedars, hee must not
seeke for them on the higher grounds, but make his inquest
for them in the vallies, for the Salvages, by this custome of
theirs, have spoiled all the rest: for this custome hath bin
continued from the beginninge.</p>

<p>And least their firing of the Country in this manner
should be an occasion of damnifying us, and indaingering
our habitations, wee our selves have used carefully about the
same times to observe the winds, and fire the grounds about
our owne habitations; to prevent the Dammage that might
happen by any neglect thereof, if the fire should come neere
those howses in our absence.</p>

<p><span class="originpage"><a id="OPage_54">{54}</a></span> For, when the fire is once kindled, it dilates and
spreads it selfe as well against, as with the winde;
burning continually night and day, untill a shower of raine
falls to quench it.</p>

<p>And this custome of firing the Country is the meanes to
make it passable; and by that meanes the trees growe here
and there as in our parks: and makes the Country very
beautifull and commodious.</p>

<p>Although Drunkennesse be justly termed a vice which
the Salvages are ignorant of, yet the benefit is very
great that comes to the planters by the sale of strong liquor
to the Salvages, who are much taken with the delight of it;
for they will pawne their wits, to purchase the acquaintance
of it. Yet in al the commerce that I had with them, I never
proffered them any such thing; nay, I would hardly let any
of them have a drame, unles hee were a Sachem, or a
Winnaytue, that is a rich man, or a man of estimation next
in degree to a Sachem or Sagamore. I alwayes tould them
it was amongst us the Sachems drinke. But they say if I
come to the Northerne parts of the Country I shall have no
trade, if I will not supply them with lusty liquors: it is the
life of the trade in all those parts: for it so happened that
thus a Salvage desperately killed himselfe; when hee was
drunke, a gunne being charged and the cock up, hee sets
the mouth to his brest, and, putting back the tricker with his
foote, shot himselfe dead.<a name="FNanchor_282_282" id="FNanchor_282_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a></p>

<p class="summary"><i>That the Salvages live a contended life.</i></p></div></div>


<p>A Gentleman and a traveller, that had bin in the parts
of New England for a time, when hee retorned againe,
in his discourse of the Country, wondered, (as hee said,) that
the natives of the land lived so poorely in so rich a Country,
like to our Beggers in England. Surely that Gentleman
had not time or leasure whiles hee was there truely to
informe himselfe of the state of that Country, and the happy
life the Salvages would leade weare they once brought to
Christianity.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The Salvages
want the art
of navigation.</i></div>

<p>I must confesse they want the use and benefit of Navigation,
(which is the very sinnus of a flourishing Commonwealth,)
yet are they supplied with all manner of needefull
things for the maintenance of life and lifelyhood. Foode
and rayment are the cheife of all that we make true use of;
and of these they finde no want, but have, and may have,
them in a most plentifull manner.<a name="FNanchor_283_283" id="FNanchor_283_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span></p>
<p>If our beggers of England should, with so much ease as
they, furnish themselves with foode at all seasons, there
would not be so many starved in the streets, neither would
so many gaoles be stuffed, or gallouses furnished with poore
wretches, as I have seene them.</p>

<p><span class="originpage"><a id="OPage_56">{56}</a></span> But they of this sort of our owne nation, that are fitt
to goe to this Canaan, are not able to transport themselves;
and most of them unwilling to goe from the good ale
tap, which is the very loadstone of the lande by which our
English beggers steere theire Course; it is the Northpole
to which the flowre-de-luce of their compasse points. The
more is the pitty that the Commonalty of oure Land are of
such leaden capacities as to neglect so brave a Country, that
doth so plentifully feede maine lusty and a brave, able men,
women and children, that have not the meanes that a Civilized
Nation hath to purchase foode and rayment; which
that Country with a little industry will yeeld a man in a
very comfortable measure, without overmuch carking.</p>

<p>I cannot deny but a civilized Nation hath the preheminence
of an uncivilized, by meanes of those instruments that
are found to be common amongst civile people, and the
uncivile want the use of, to make themselves masters of
those ornaments that make such a glorious shew, that will
give a man occasion to cry, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sic transit gloria Mundi</i>.</p>

<p>Now since it is but foode and rayment that men that live
needeth, (though not all alike,) why should not the Natives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
of New England be sayd to live richly, having no want of
either? Cloaths are the badge of sinne; and the more variety
of fashions is but the greater abuse of the Creature: the
beasts of the forrest there doe serve to furnish them at any
time when they please: fish and flesh they have in greate
abundance, which they both roast and boyle.</p>

<p><span class="originpage"><a id="OPage_57">{57}</a></span> They are indeed not served in dishes of plate with
variety of Sauces to procure appetite; that needs not
there. The rarity of the aire, begot by the medicinable
quality of the sweete herbes of the Country, alwayes procures
good stomakes to the inhabitants.</p>

<p>I must needs commend them in this particular, that,
though they buy many commodities of our Nation, yet they
keepe but fewe, and those of speciall use.</p>

<p>They love not to bee cumbered with many utensilles, and
although every proprietor knowes his owne, yet all things,
(so long as they will last), are used in common amongst
them: A bisket cake given to one, that one breakes it
equally into so many parts as there be persons in his company,
and distributes it. Platoes Commonwealth is so much
practised by these people.</p>


<p>According to humane reason, guided onely by the light
of nature, these people leades the more happy and freer


<span class="sidenote"><i>They leade a
happy life,
being voyd of
care.</i></span>

life, being voyde of care, which torments the mindes of so
many Christians: They are not delighted in baubles, but
in usefull things.</p>

<p>Their naturall drinke is of the Cristall fountaine, and
this they take up in their hands, by joyning them close together.
They take up a great quantity at a time, and drinke
at the wrists. It was the sight of such a feate which made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
Diogenes hurle away his dishe, and, like one that would
have this principall confirmed, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Natura paucis contentat</i>, used
a dish no more.</p>


<p><span class="originpage"><a id="OPage_58">{58}</a></span> I have observed that they will not be troubled with
superfluous commodities. Such things as they finde
they are taught by necessity to make use of, they will make
choise of, and seeke to purchase with industry. So that, in
respect that their life is so voyd of care, and they are so
loving also that they make use of those things they enjoy,
(the wife onely excepted,) as common goods, and are therein


<span class="sidenote"><i>They make

things,

so compassionate that, rather than one should starve through
want, they would starve all. Thus doe they passe awaye the
time merrily, not regarding our pompe, (which they see dayly
before their faces,) but are better content with their owne,
which some men esteeme so meanely of.</p>

<p>They may be rather accompted to live richly, wanting
nothing that is needefull; and to be commended for leading
a contented life, the younger being ruled by the Elder, and
the Elder ruled by the Powahs, and the Powahs are ruled by
the Devill;<a name="FNanchor_284_284" id="FNanchor_284_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a> and then you may imagin what good

them.</p>

<p>Now that I have breifly shewed the Commodity of the

<p>And first of the Swanne,<a name="FNanchor_312_312" id="FNanchor_312_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a> because shee is the biggest of all
the fowles of that Country. There are of them in Merrimack
River, and in other parts of the country, greate store
at the seasons of the yeare.</p>

<p>The flesh is not much desired of the inhabitants, but the

both for fethers and quiles.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Geese, pide,

the flesh farre more excellent then the Geese of England,
wild or tame; yet the purity of the aire is such that the
biggest is accompted but an indifferent meale for a couple
of men. There is of them great abundance. I have had
often 1000. before the mouth of my gunne. I never

a bedd softer then any down bed that I have lyen on, and is

there a very good commodity; the fethers of the Geese, that
I have killed in a short time, have paid for all the powther
and shott I have spent in a yeare, and I have fed my doggs
with as fatt Geese there as I have euer fed upon my selfe
in England.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Ducks pide,
gray, &amp; black.</i></div>

<p>Ducks there are of three kindes, pide Ducks, gray Ducks,
and black Ducks in greate abundance: the most about my
habitation were black Ducks:<a name="FNanchor_316_316" id="FNanchor_316_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a> and it was a noted Custome
at my howse, to have every mans Duck upon a trencher;
and then you will thinke a man was not hardly used: they
are bigger boddied then the tame Ducks of England: very
fatt and dainty flesh.</p>

<p>The common doggs fees were the gibletts, unlesse they
were boyled now and than for to make broath.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Teales, greene

winged:<a name="FNanchor_317_317" id="FNanchor_317_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a> but a dainty bird. I have bin much delighted with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
a rost of these for a second course. I had plenty in the

<p>Widggens<a name="FNanchor_318_318" id="FNanchor_318_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a> there are, and abundance of other water foule,
some such as I have seene, and [some] such as I have not
seene else where before I came into those parts, which are
little regarded.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Simpes.</i></div>

<p>Simpes<a name="FNanchor_319_319" id="FNanchor_319_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a> there are like our Simpes in all respects, with
very litle difference. I have shot at them onely to see what
difference I could finde betweene them and those of my
native Country, and more I did not regard them.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Sanderlings.</i></div>

than a Snipe; and I was much delighted to feede on
them because they were fatt and easie to come by, because
I went but a stepp or to for them: and I have killed betweene
foure and five dozen at a shoot, which would loade
me home.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span></p>

<p>Their foode is at ebbing water on the sands, of small seeds
that grows on weeds there, and are very good pastime in
August.</p>

<p>Cranes<a name="FNanchor_321_321" id="FNanchor_321_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a> there are greate store, that ever more came there
at S. Davids day, and not before: that day they never would
misse.</p>

<p>These sometimes eate our corne, and doe pay for their presumption
well enough; and serveth there in powther, with
turnips, to supply the place of powthered beefe, and is a
goodly bird in a dishe, and no discommodity.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Turkies.</i></div>

<p>Turkies<a name="FNanchor_322_322" id="FNanchor_322_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a> there are, which divers times in great flocks have
sallied by our doores; and then a gunne, being commonly
in a redinesse, salutes them with such a courtesie, as makes
them take a turne in the Cooke roome. They daunce by
the doore so well.</p>

<p>Of these there hath bin killed that have weighed forty
eight pound a peece.<a name="FNanchor_323_323" id="FNanchor_323_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span></p>

<p>They are by mainy degrees sweeter then the tame Turkies
of England, feede them how you can.</p>

<p>I had a Salvage who hath taken out his boy in a morning,
and they have brought home their loades about noone.</p>

<p><span class="originpage"><a id="OPage_70">{70}</a></span> I have asked them what number they found in the
woods, who have answered Neent Metawna,<a name="FNanchor_324_324" id="FNanchor_324_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a> which is
a thosand that day; the plenty of them is such in those parts.
They are easily killed at rooste, because, the one being killed,
the other sit fast neverthelesse; and this is no bad commodity.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Pheisants.</i></div>

take upon mee to determine. They are in forme like our
pheisant henne of England. Both the male and the female
are alike; but they are rough footed, and have stareing fethers
about the head and neck; the body is as bigg as the
pheysant henne of England; and are excellent white flesh,
and delicate white meate, yet we seldome bestowe a shoote at
them.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Partridges

<p>Partridges<a name="FNanchor_326_326" id="FNanchor_326_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a> there are, much like our Partridges of England;
they are of the same plumes, but bigger in body.
They have not the signe of the horseshoe on the brest, as the
Partridges of England; nor are they coloured about the
heads as those are. They sit on the trees, for I have seene
40. in one tree at a time: yet at night they fall on the
ground, and sit untill morning so together; and are dainty
flesh.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Quailes bigger

England.</p>

neede I to make any Apology for my selfe concerning any

which I reclaimed, trained and made flying in a fortnight,
the same being a passenger at Michuelmas. I found
that these are most excellent Mettell, rank winged, well conditioned,
and not tickleish footed; and, having whoods, bels,
luers, and all things fitting, was desirous to make experiment
of that kinde of Hawke before any other.</p>

<p>And I am perswaded that Nature hath ordained them to
be of a farre better kinde then any that have bin used in
England.<a name="FNanchor_332_332" id="FNanchor_332_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a> They have neither dorre<a name="FNanchor_333_333" id="FNanchor_333_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a> nor worm to feed upon,

more black then any that have bin used in England.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span></p>

for a person of estimation among the Indians to weare in the
knot of his lock, with the traine upright, the body dried and
stretched out. They take a great pride in the wearing of
such an ornament, and give to one of us, that shall kill them
one for that purpose, so much beaver as is worth three
pounds sterling, very willingly.</p>

<p>These doe us but little trespas, because they pray on such
birds as are by the Sea side, and not on our Chickens. Goshawkes

are well shaped, but they are small; some of white male,
and some redd male, I have seene one with 8. barres in the
traine. These fall on our bigger poultry: the lesser chicken,
I thinke they scorne to make their pray of; for commonly
the Cocke goes to wrack. Of these I have seene many;
and if they come to trespasse me, I lay the law to them with
the gunne, and take them dammage fesant.</p>

I turned him going; but, for so much as I have observed of

<p>Now that I have made a rehearsall of the birds and
fethered Fowles, which participate most of aire, I will
give you a description of the beasts; and shew you what
beasts are bred in those parts, and what my experience
hath gathered by observation of <span class="originpage"><a id="OPage_74">{74}</a></span> their kinde and
nature. I begin with the most usefull and most
beneficiall beast which is bredd in those parts, which is
the Deare.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Deare of 3.
kindes.</i></div>

<p>There are in this Country three kindes of Deare, of which
there are greate plenty, and those are very usefull.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Mose or red
deare.</i></div>

<p>First, therefore, I will speake of the Elke, which the Salvages
call a Mose:<a name="FNanchor_345_345" id="FNanchor_345_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a> it is a very large Deare, with a very faire
head, and a broade palme, like the palme of a fallow Deares
horne, but much bigger, and is 6. footewide betweene the
tipps, which grow curbing downwards: Hee is of the bignesse
of a great horse.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Mose or
deare greater
than a horse,
the height of
them 18.
hand fulles.</i></div>

<p>There have bin of them seene that has bin 18. handfulls
highe: hee hath a bunch of haire under his jawes: hee is
not swifte, but stronge and large in body, and longe legged;
in somuch that hee doth use to kneele, when hee feedeth
on grasse.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>They bringe
forth three
faunes at one
time.</i></div>

<p>Hee bringeth forth three faunes, or younge ones, at a
time; and, being made tame, would be good for draught,
and more usefull (by reason of their strength) then the Elke
of Raushea.<a name="FNanchor_346_346" id="FNanchor_346_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a> These are found very frequent in the northerne<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
parts of New England: their flesh is very good foode, and
much better then our redd Deare of England.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>They make
good lether of
the hides of
Deare.</i></div>

<p>Their hids are by the Salvages converted into very good
lether, and dressed as white as milke.</p>

<p>Of this lether the Salvages make the best shooes; and use
to barter away the skinnes to other Salvages that have
none of that kinde of bests in the parts where they
live. Very good buffe may be made of the <span class="originpage"><a id="OPage_75">{75}</a></span> hids. I
have seene a hide as large as any horse hide that can
be found. There is such abundance of them that the Salvages,
at hunting time, have killed of them so many, that they
have bestowed six or seaven at a time upon one English man
whome they have borne affection to.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The midling
Deare or fallow
Deare.</i></div>

<p>There is a second sort of Deare<a name="FNanchor_347_347" id="FNanchor_347_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a> (lesse then the redd Deare
of England, but much bigger then the English fallow Deare)
swift of foote, but of a more darke coloure; with some griseld
heares, when his coate is full growne in the summer season;
his hornes grow curving, with a croked beame, resembling
our redd Deare, not with a palme like the fallow Deare.</p>

<p>These bringe 3. fawnes at a time,<a name="FNanchor_348_348" id="FNanchor_348_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a> spotted like our fallow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
Deares fawnes; the Salvages say, foure; I speake of what I
know to be true, for I have killed in February a doe with
three fawnes in her belly, all heared, and ready to fall; for
these Deare fall their fawnes 2. moneths sooner then the
fallow Deare of England. There is such abundance of
them that an hundred have bin found at the spring of the
yeare, within the compasse of a mile.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Trappes to
catch the
Deare.</i></div>

<p>The Salvages take these in trappes made of their naturall
Hempe, which they place in the earth where they fell a
tree for browse; and when hee rounds the tree for the
browse, if hee tread on the trapp hee is horsed up by the
legg, by meanes of a pole that starts up and catcheth him.<a name="FNanchor_349_349" id="FNanchor_349_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a></p>

<p>Their hides the Saluages use for cloathing, and will give
for one hide killed in season, 2. 3. or 4. beaver skinnes,
which will yeild pounds a peece in that Coun<span class="originpage"><a id="OPage_76">{76}</a></span>try: so
much is the Deares hide prised with them above the
beaver. I have made good merchandize of these. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
flesh is farre sweeter then the venison of England: and hee
feedeth fatt and leane together, as a swine or mutton, where
as our Deare of England feede fatt on the out side: they
doe not croake at rutting time, nor spendle shafte, nor is
their flesh discoloured at rutting. Hee, that will impale
ground fitting, may be brought once in the yeare where with
bats and men hee may take so many to put into that parke,
as the hides will pay the chardge of impaleinge. If all
these things be well considered, the Deare, as well as the
Mose, may have a principall place in the catalogue of commodities.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The Humbles
was the
doggs fee.</i></div>

<p>I for my part may be bould to tell you, that my howse
was not without the flesh of this sort of Deare winter nor
summer: the humbles was ever my dogges fee, which by the
wesell<a name="FNanchor_350_350" id="FNanchor_350_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a> was hanged on the barre in the chimney, for his diet
only: for hee has brought to my stand a brace in a morning,
one after the other before sunne rising, which I have killed.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Roe bucks or
Rayne Deare.</i></div>

<p>There is likewise a third sorte of deare,<a name="FNanchor_351_351" id="FNanchor_351_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a> lesse then the
other, (which are a kinde of rayne deare,) to the southward
of all the English plantations: they are excellent good flesh.
And these also bring three fawnes at a time; and in this
particular the Deare of those parts excell all the knowne
Deare of the whole world.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Wolfes pray
upon Deare.</i></div>

<p>On all these the Wolfes doe pray continually. The best<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
meanes they have to escape the wolfes is by swimming
to Islands,<a name="FNanchor_352_352" id="FNanchor_352_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a> or necks of land, whereby <span class="originpage"><a id="OPage_77">{77}</a></span> they
escape: for the wolfe will not presume to follow them
untill they see them over a river; then, being landed, (they
wayting on the shore,) undertake the water, and so follow
with fresh suite.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Beaver.</i></div>

<p>The next in mine opinion fit to be spoaken of, is the
Beaver;<a name="FNanchor_353_353" id="FNanchor_353_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a> which is a Beast ordained for land and water both,
and hath fore feete like a cunny, her hinder feete like a
goese, mouthed like a cunny, but short eared like a Serat.
[He feeds on] fishe in summer, and wood in winter; which
hee conveyes to his howse built on the water, wherein hee
sitts with his tayle hanging in the water, which else would
over heate and rot off.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The Beavers
cut downe
trees, with his
fore teeth.</i></div>

<p>Hee cuts the bodies of trees downe with his fore-teeth,
which are so long as a boares tuskes, and with the help of other
beavers, (which hold by each others tayles like a teeme of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
horses, the hindmost with the logg on his shoulder stayed by
one of his fore feete against his head,) they draw the logg to
the habitation appoynted, placing the loggs in a square; and
so, by pyling one uppon another, they build up a howse,
which with boghes is covered very strongly, and placed in
some pond, to which they make a damme of brush wood,
like a hedge, so stronge that I have gone on the top of it
crosse the current of that pond. The flesh of this beast is
excellent foode. The fleece is a very choise furre, which,
(before the Salvages had commerce with Christians,) they
burned of the tayle: this beast is of a masculine vertue for
the advancement of Priapus,<a name="FNanchor_354_354" id="FNanchor_354_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_354_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a> and is preserved for a dish for
the Sachems, or Sagamores; who are the princes of the
people, but not Kings, (as is fondly supposed.)</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Beaver at
10. shil.
a pound.</i></div>

<p><span class="originpage"><a id="OPage_78">{78}</a></span> The skinnes are the best marchantable commodity
that can be found, to cause ready money to be brought
into the land, now that they are raised to 10. shillings a
pound.<a name="FNanchor_355_355" id="FNanchor_355_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>In 5 yeares
one man gott

<p>A servant of mine in 5. yeares was thought to have a 1000.
p. in ready gold gotten by beaver when hee dyed;<a name="FNanchor_356_356" id="FNanchor_356_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_356_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a> whatsoever
became of it. And this beast may challenge preheminence
in the Catalogue.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The Otter in
winter hath
a furre as
black as Iett.</i></div>

<p>The Otter<a name="FNanchor_357_357" id="FNanchor_357_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a> of those parts, in winter season, hath a furre so
black as jett; and is a furre of very highe price: a good
black skinne is worth 3. or 4. Angels of gold. The Flesh
is eaten by the Salvages: but how good it is I cannot shew,
because it is not eaten by our Nation. Yet is this a beast
that ought to be placed in the number amongst the Commodities
of the Country.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The Luseran

<p>The Luseran, or Luseret,<a name="FNanchor_358_358" id="FNanchor_358_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_358_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a> is a beast like a Catt, but so bigg
as a great hound: with a tayle shorter then a Catt. His
clawes are like a Catts. Hee will make a pray of the Deare.
His Flesh is dainty meat, like a lambe: his hide is a choise
furre, and accompted a good commodity.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The Martin

<p>The Martin<a name="FNanchor_359_359" id="FNanchor_359_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_359_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a> is a beast about the bignes of a Foxe. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
furre is chestnutt coloure: and of those there are greate store
in the Northerne parts of the Country, and is a good commodity.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Racowne.</i></div>

<p>The Racowne<a name="FNanchor_360_360" id="FNanchor_360_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a> is a beast as bigg, full out, as a Foxe, with

Salvages for coats, and is with those people of more
esteeme then a coate of beaver, <span class="originpage"><a id="OPage_79">{79}</a></span> because of the tayles
that (hanging round in their order) doe adorne the
garment, and is therefore so much esteemed of them. His
fore feete are like the feete of an ape; and by the print
thereof, in the time of snow, he is followed to his hole, which
is commonly in a hollow tree; from whence hee is fiered
out, and so taken.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The Foxes

<p>The Foxes are of two coloures; the one redd, the other

some griselled, and some black: their foode is fish, which
they catch when they passe up the rivers into the ponds to
spawne, at the spring time. The Deare are also their pray,
and at summer, when they have whelpes, the bitch will fetch
a puppy dogg from our dores to feede their whelpes with.
They are fearefull Curres, and will runne away from a man,
(that meeteth them by chaunce at a banke end,) as fast as
any fearefull dogge.<a name="FNanchor_365_365" id="FNanchor_365_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a> These pray upon the Deare very much.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
The skinnes are used by the Salvages, especially the skinne
of the black wolfe, which is esteemed a present for a prince
there.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The skin of a

<p>When there ariseth any difference betweene prince and
prince, the prince that desires to be reconciled to his neighboring

him a black wolfes skinne for a present, and the acceptance
of such a present is an assurance of reconciliation betweene
them; and the <span class="originpage"><a id="OPage_80">{80}</a></span> Salvages will willingly give
40. beaver skinnes for the purchase of one of these
black Wolfes skinnes:<a name="FNanchor_366_366" id="FNanchor_366_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_366_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a> and allthough the beast himselfe be
a discommodity, which other Countries of Christendome are
subject unto, yet is the skinne of the black wolfe worthy the
title of a commodity, in that respect that hath bin declared.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The Beares

<p>If I should not speake something of the beare,<a name="FNanchor_367_367" id="FNanchor_367_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_367_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a> I might
happily leave a scruple in the mindes of some effeminate
persone who conceaved of more dainger in them then there
is cause. Therefore, to incourage them against all Feare
and Fortifie their mindes against needles danger, I will
relate what experience hath taught mee concerning them:
they are beasts that doe no harme in those parts; they feede
upon Hurtleburies, Nuts and Fish, especially shell-fish.</p>

<p>The Beare is a tyrant at a Lobster, and at low water
will downe to the Rocks and groape after them with great
diligence.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The Salvages

<p>Hee will runne away from a man as fast as a litle dogge.
If a couple of Salvages chaunce to espie him at his banquet,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
his running away will not serve his turne, for they will coate
him, and chase him betweene them home to theire howses,
where they kill him, to save a laboure in carrying him farre.

beefe.<a name="FNanchor_368_368" id="FNanchor_368_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_368_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a></p>

a small beast, lesse then a Cunny, and is indeede in
those parts no other then a water Ratte; for I have seene<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
the suckers of them digged out of a banke, and at that age
they neither differed in shape, coloure, nor size, from one of
our greate Ratts. When hee is ould, hee is of the Beavers
coloure; and hath passed in waite with our Chapmen for
Beaver.</p>

<p>The Male of them have stones, which the Salvages, in uncaseing
of them, leave to the skinne, which is a most delicate
perfume, and may compare with any perfume that I

<p>There is one creeping beast or longe creeple, (as the name

discover his age; for so many yeares as hee hath lived,
so many joynts are in that rattle, which soundeth (when
it is in motion,) like pease in a bladder; and this beast

than the Adder of England, nor no more. I have had my

that I had thought it would have bin his death: but with
one Saucer of Salet oyle powred downe his throate
he <span class="originpage"><a id="OPage_83">{83}</a></span> has recovered, and the swelling asswaged by the

Plimmouth after hee had played the unhappy Markes man
when hee was pursued by a carelesse fellow that was new
come into the Land,) they say laboured to get a patent of
it to himselfe. Hee was beloved of many, and had many
sonnes that had a minde to engrosse that commodity. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>

<p>Among Fishes, first I will begin with the Codd, because
it is the most commodious of all fish, as may appeare
by the use which is made of them in forraigne parts.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Codd.</i></div>

<p>The Codd fishing is much used in America, (whereof New
England is a part,) in so much as 300. Sayle of shipps,
from divers parts, have used to be imployed yearely in that
trade.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>15. Shipps at one time for Codd.</i></div>

<p>I have seene in one Harboure,<a name="FNanchor_405_405" id="FNanchor_405_405"></a><a href="#Footnote_405_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a> next Richmond Iland, 15.
Sayle of shipps at one time, that have taken in them driyed
Codds for Spaine and the Straights, and it has bin found
that the Saylers have made 15. 18. 20. 22. p. share for a
common man.</p>

<p>The Coast aboundeth with such multitudes of Codd<a name="FNanchor_406_406" id="FNanchor_406_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_406_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a> that
the inhabitants of New England doe dunge their grounds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
with Codd; and it is a commodity better than the golden
mines of the Spanish Indies; for without dried Codd the
Spaniard, Portingal and Italian would not be able to vittel
of a shipp for the Sea; and I am sure at the Canaries it is
the principall commodity: which place lyeth neere
New Eng<span class="originpage"><a id="OPage_87">{87}</a></span>land, very convenient for the vending of
this commodity, one hundred of these being at the
price of 300. of New found land Codds: greate store of



<span class="sidenote"><i>Oyle mayd of

traine oyle<a name="FNanchor_407_407" id="FNanchor_407_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_407_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a> is mayd of the livers of the Codd, and is a commodity
that without question will enrich the inhabitants of
New England quicly; and is therefore a principall commodity.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>A 100 Basse
sould for 5. p.</i></div>

<p>The Basse<a name="FNanchor_408_408" id="FNanchor_408_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_408_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a> is an excellent Fish, both fresh and Salte; one
hundred whereof salted, (at a market,) have yeilded 5. p.
They are so large, the head of one will give a good eater a
dinner; and for daintinesse of diet they excell the Mary-bones
of Beefe. There are such multitudes, that I have
seene stopped into the river close adjoyning to my howse,
with a sand at one tide, so many as will loade a ship of a
100. Tonnes.</p>

<p>Other places have greater quantities, in so much as wagers
have bin layed that one should not throw a stone in the
water but that hee should hit a fish.</p>

<p>I my selfe, at the turning of the tyde, have seene such
multitudes passe out of a pound, that it seemed to mee that
one might goe over their backs drishod.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span></p>

<p>These follow the bayte up the rivers, and sometimes are
followed for bayte and chased into the bayes, and shallow
waters, by the grand pise:<a name="FNanchor_409_409" id="FNanchor_409_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_409_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a> and these may have also a prime
place in the Catalogue of Commodities.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Mackarell
are baite for
Basse.</i></div>

<p>The Mackarels are the baite for the Basse, and these
have bin chased into the shallow waters where so many
thousands have shott themselves a shore with the surfe of the
Sea, that whole hogges-heads have bin taken up on
the Sands; and for length, they excell <span class="originpage"><a id="OPage_88">{88}</a></span> any of other
parts: they have bin measured 18. and 19. inches in
length and seaven in breadth: and are taken with a drayle,<a name="FNanchor_410_410" id="FNanchor_410_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_410_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a>
(as boats use to passe to and froe at Sea on businesse,) in very
greate quantities all alonge the Coaste.</p>

<p>The Fish is good, salted, for store against the winter, as
well as fresh; and to be accounted a good Commodity.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Sturgeon.</i></div>

<p>This Sturgeon in England is <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">regalis piscis</i>;<a name="FNanchor_411_411" id="FNanchor_411_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_411_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a> every man in
New England may catch what hee will: there are multitudes
of them, and they are much fatter then those that are
brought into England from other parts, in so much as by
reason of their fatnesse they doe not looke white, but yellow,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
which made a Cooke presume they were not so good as
them of Roushea: silly fellow that could not understand
that it is the nature of fish salted, or pickelled, the fatter the
yellower being best to preserve.<a name="FNanchor_412_412" id="FNanchor_412_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_412_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a></p>

<p>For the taste, I have warrant of Ladies of worth, with
choise pallats for the commendations, who liked the taste so
well that they esteemed it beyond the Sturgeon of other
parts, and sayd they were deceaved in the lookes: therefore
let the Sturgeon passe for a Commodity.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Salmon.</i></div>

allowed for a Commodity, and placed in the Catallogue.</p>

<p><span class="originpage"><a id="OPage_89">{89}</a></span> Of Eeles there is abundance, both in the Salt-waters

that at the spring of the yeare passe up the rivers to spaune
in the ponds; and are taken in such multitudes in every
river, that hath a pond at the end, that the Inhabitants
doung their ground with them. You may see in one towneship
a hundred acres together set with these Fish, every acre
taking 1000. of them: and an acre thus dressed will produce
and yeald so much corne as 3. acres without fish: and,
least any Virginea man would inferre hereupon that the
ground of New England is barren, because they use no fish
in setting their corne, I desire them to be remembred the
cause is plaine, in Virginea they have it not to sett. But
this practise is onely for the Indian Maize, (which must be
set by hands,) not for English graine: and this is therefore
a commodity there.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Turbut or

some are taken so bigg that two men have much a
doe to hale them into the boate; but there is <span class="originpage"><a id="OPage_90">{90}</a></span> such
plenty, that the fisher men onely eate the heads and
finnes, and throw away the bodies: such in Paris would
yeeld 5. or 6. crownes a peece: and this is no discommodity.</p>

(at flowing water,) do almost come ashore, so that one may
stepp but halfe a foote deepe and prick them up on the
sands and this may passe with some allowance.</p>

them, in 5. yeares after I came there, was but to baite my
Hooke for to catch Basse; I had bin so cloyed with them
the first day I went a shore.</p>

<p>This being knowne, they shall passe for a commodity to
the inhabitants; for the Salvages will meete 500, or 1000.
at a place where Lobsters come in with the tyde, to eate,
and save dried for store; abiding in that place, feasting and
sporting, a moneth or 6. weekes together.<a name="FNanchor_421_421" id="FNanchor_421_421"></a><a href="#Footnote_421_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a></p>

<p>It is tenne yeares since first the relation of these things

<p>Wee supposed, when they spake of Beasts thereabouts as

they eate of the Beavers, to which they replyed Matta,<a name="FNanchor_443_443" id="FNanchor_443_443"></a><a href="#Footnote_443_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a> (noe)

<p>About the parts of this Lake may be made a very greate

him to that purpose; who no doubt will performe as
much as is expected, if the Dutch, (by gettinge into those
parts before him,) doe not frustrate his so hopefull and
laudable designes.</p>

<p>It is well knowne they aime at that place, and have a possibility
to attaine unto the end of their desires therein, by
meanes of the River of Mohegan, which of the English is
named Hudsons River, where the Dutch have setled two
well fortified plantations already. If that River be derived
from the Lake, as our Country man in his prospect<a name="FNanchor_446_446" id="FNanchor_446_446"></a><a href="#Footnote_446_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a> affirmes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
it to be, and if they get and fortifie this place also, they will
gleane away the best of the Beaver both from the French
and the English, who have hitherto lived wholely by it; and
very many old planters have gained good estates out of small
beginnings by meanes thereof.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The Dutch

<p>The Salvages make report of 3. great Rivers that issue
out of this Lake, 2. of which are to us knowne, the one to
be Patomack, the other Canada: and why may not the
third be found there likewise, which they describe to trend
westward, which is conceaved to discharge herselfe into the
South Sea? The Salvages affirme that they have seene
shipps in this Lake with 4. Masts, which have taken from
thence for their ladinge earth, that is conjectured to be
some minerall stuffe.</p>

<p><span class="originpage"><a id="OPage_100">{100}</a></span> There is probability enough for this; and it may
well be thought that so great a confluxe of waters as are
there gathered together, must be vented by some great Rivers;
and that if the third River, (which they have made mention
of,) proove to be true, as the other two have done, there



<span class="sidenote"><i>The passage

is no doubt but that the passage to the East India may be
obtained without any such daingerous and fruitlesse inquest
by the Norwest, as hetherto hath bin endeavoured: And
there is no Traveller of any resonable capacity but will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
graunt that about this Lake must be innumerable springes,
and by that meanes many fruitfull and pleasant pastures all
about it. It hath bin observed that the inland part, (witnes
Neepnet,<a name="FNanchor_448_448" id="FNanchor_448_448"></a><a href="#Footnote_448_448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a>) are more pleasant and fertile then the borders of
the Sea coaste. And the Country about Erocoise is, (not


<span class="sidenote"><i>The Country
of Erocois as
fertile as
Delta in Ægypt.</i></span>

without good cause,) compared to Delta, the most fertile
parte in all Ægypt, that aboundeth with Rivers and Rivalets
derived from Nilus fruitfull channell, like vaines from the
liver; so in each respect is this famous Lake of Erocoise.</p>

<p>And, therefore, it would be adjudged an irreparable oversight
to protract time, and suffer the Dutch, (who are but
intruders upon his Majesties most hopefull Country of New
England,) to possesse themselves of that so plesant and
commodious Country of Erocoise before us: being, (as appeareth,)
the principall part of all New Canaan for plantation,
and not elsewhere to be paralelld in all the knowne
world.</p>

hee betakes him to his progresse into the Inlande for Beaver,
with his carriadge on his shoulders like Milo: his guides and
hee in processe of time come to the place appointed, which
was about Neepenett,<a name="FNanchor_479_479" id="FNanchor_479_479"></a><a href="#Footnote_479_479" class="fnanchor">[479]</a> thereabouts being more Beavers to be

glad hee was good man, and his guides were willing to pleas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>ure
him: there the Salvages stay: night came on, but, before
they were inclined to sleepe, this good man Master Bubble
had an evation crept into his head, by misapplying the Salvages
actions, that hee must needs be gone in all hast, yea and
without his errand: hee purposed to doe it so cunningely
that his flight should not <span class="originpage"><a id="OPage_127">{127}</a></span> be suspected: hee
leaves his shooes in the howse, with all his other
implements, and flies: as hee was on his way, to increase
his feare, suggestinge himselfe that hee was pressed<a name="FNanchor_480_480" id="FNanchor_480_480"></a><a href="#Footnote_480_480" class="fnanchor">[480]</a> by a
company of Indians and that there shafts were let fly as thick
as haile at him, hee puts of his breeches and puts them one
his head, for to save him from the shafts that flew after him
so thick that no man could perceave them, and cryinge out,
avoyd Satan, what have yee to doe with mee! thus running
one his way without his breeches hee was pittifully scratched
with the brush of the underwoods, as hee wandred up and
downe in unknowne wayes: The Salvages in the meane
time put up all his implements in the sack hee left behinde
and brought them to Wessaguscus, where they thought to
have found him; but, understanding hee was not returned,
were ferefull what to doe, and what would be conceaved of
the English was become of this mazed man, the Master of
the Ceremonies; and were in consultation of the matter.
One of the Salvages was of opinion the English would suppose
him to be made away; fearefull hee was to come in
sight. The other, better acquainted with the English, (having
lived some time in England,<a name="FNanchor_481_481" id="FNanchor_481_481"></a><a href="#Footnote_481_481" class="fnanchor">[481]</a>) was more confident, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
hee perswaded his fellow that the English would be satisfied
with relation of the truth, as having had testimony of his
fidelity. So they boldly adventured to shew what they had



<span class="sidenote"><i>They take a
note of what
was in the
sack.</i></span>

brougt and how the matter stood. The English, (when the
sack was opened,) did take a note in writing of all the particulers
that were in the sack; and heard what was by
the Salvages related of the acci<span class="originpage"><a id="OPage_128">{128}</a></span>dents: but, when his
shoes were showne, it was thought hee would not have
departed without his shoes; and therefore they did conceave
that Master Bubble was made away by some sinister practise
of the Salvages, who unadvisedly had bin culpable of a crime
which now they sought to excuse; and straightly chardged
the Salvages to finde him out againe, and bring him dead,



<span class="sidenote"><i>Mr. Bubble
must be
found againe
or else they
shall be destroyed.</i></span>

or alive, else their wifes and children should be destroyed.
The poore Salvages, being in a pittifull perplexity, caused
their Countrymen to seeke out for this maz’d man; who,
being in short time found, was brought to Wessaguscus;
where hee made a discourse of his travels, and of the perrillous
passages, which did seeme to be no lesse dangerous then
these of that worthy Knight Errant, Don Quixote,<a name="FNanchor_482_482" id="FNanchor_482_482"></a><a href="#Footnote_482_482" class="fnanchor">[482]</a> and how
miraculously hee had bin preserved; and, in conclusion,
lamented the greate losse of his goods, whereby hee thought
himselfe undone.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Not any
thing diminished.</i></div>

<p>The perticuler whereof being demaunded, it appeared that
the Salvages had not diminished any part of them; no, not
so much as one bit of bread: the number being knowne,
and the fragments laid together, it appeared all the bisket<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
was preserved, and not any diminished at all: whereby the
Master of the Ceremonies was overjoyed, and the whole
Company made themselves merry at his discourse of all his
perrillous adventures.</p>

<p>And by this you may observe whether the Salvage people
are not full of humanity, or whether they are a dangerous
people, as Master Bubble and the rest of his tribe would perswade
you.</p>

<p>The Inhabitants of Pasonagessit, (having translated the

amongst themselves to have it performed in a solemne manner,

[they] prepared to sett up a Maypole upon the festivall day

of Philip and Iacob, and therefore brewed a barrell of excellent
beare and provided a case of bottles, to be spent, with
other good cheare, for all commers of that day. And because
they would have it in a compleat forme, they had prepared a
song fitting to the time and present occasion. And upon
Mayday they brought the Maypole to the place appointed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
with drumes, gunnes, pistols and other fitting instruments,
for that purpose; and there erected it with the help of Salvages,
that came thether of purpose to see the manner of our
Revels. A goodly pine tree of 80. foote longe was reared
up, with a peare of buckshorns nayled one somewhat neare
unto the top of it: where it stood, as a faire sea marke for
directions how to finde out the way to mine Hoste of Ma-re
Mount.</p>

<p>And because it should more fully appeare to what end it
was placed there, they had a poem in readines made, which
was fixed to the Maypole, to shew the new name confirmed
upon that plantation; which, allthough it were made

the Calfe of Horeb, and stood at defiance with the place,
naming it Mount Dagon; threatning to make it a woefull
mount and not a merry mount.</p>

<p>The Riddle, for want of Oedipus, they could not expound;
onely they made some explication of part of it, and sayd it
was meant by Sampson Iob, the carpenter of the shipp that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
brought over a woman to her husband, that had bin there
longe before and thrived so well that hee sent for her and her
children to come to him; where shortly after hee died: having
no reason, but because of the sound of those two words;
when as, (the truth is,) the man they applyed it to was altogether
unknowne to the Author.</p>

<p>There was likewise a merry song made, which, (to make
their Revells more fashionable,) was sung with a Corus, every
man bearing his part; which they performed in a daunce,
hand in hand about the Maypole, whiles one of the Company
sung and filled out the good liquor, like gammedes

<p>This harmeles mirth made by younge men, (that lived in
hope to have wifes brought over to them, that would save
them a laboure to make a voyage to fetch any over,) was
much distasted of the precise Seperatists, that keepe much
a doe about the tyth of Muit and Cummin, troubling their
braines more then reason would require about things that
are indifferent: and from that time sought occasion
against my <span class="originpage"><a id="OPage_136">{136}</a></span> honest Host of Ma-re Mount, to overthrow
his ondertakings and to destroy his plantation
quite and cleane. But because they presumed with their
imaginary gifts, (which they have out of Phaos box,<a name="FNanchor_487_487" id="FNanchor_487_487"></a><a href="#Footnote_487_487" class="fnanchor">[487]</a>) they
could expound hidden misteries, to convince them of blindnes,
as well in this as in other matters of more consequence,
I will illustrate the poem, according to the true intent of the
authors of these Revells, so much distasted by those Moles.</p>

<p>Oedipus is generally receaved for the absolute reader of
riddles, who is invoaked: Silla and Caribdis are two danger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>ous
places for seamen to incounter, neere unto Vennice;
and have bin by poets formerly resembled to man and wife.
The like licence the author challenged for a paire of his
nomination, the one lamenting for the losse of the other as
Niobe for her children. Amphitrite is an arme of the Sea,
by which the newes was carried up and downe of a rich
widow, now to be tane up or laid downe. By Triton is the
fame spread that caused the Suters to muster, (as it had bin
to Penellope of Greece;) and, the Coast lying circuler, all
our passage to and froe is made more convenient by Sea
then Land. Many aimed at this marke; but hee that played
Proteus best and could comply with her humor must be the
man that would carry her; and hee had need have Sampsons
strenght to deale with a Dallila, and as much patience
as Iob that should come there, for a thing that I did observe
in the life-time of the former.</p>

<p>But marriage and hanging, (they say,) comes by desteny
and Scogans choise<a name="FNanchor_488_488" id="FNanchor_488_488"></a><a href="#Footnote_488_488" class="fnanchor">[488]</a> tis better [than] none at all.
Hee that <span class="originpage"><a id="OPage_137">{137}</a></span> playd Proteus, (with the helpe of Priapus,)
put their noses out of joynt, as the Proverbe is.</p>

<p>And this the whole company of the Revellers at Ma-re
Mount knew to be the true sence and exposition of the
riddle that was fixed to the Maypole, which the Seperatists
were at defiance with. Some of them affirmed that the first
institution thereof was in memory of a whore;<a name="FNanchor_489_489" id="FNanchor_489_489"></a><a href="#Footnote_489_489" class="fnanchor">[489]</a> not knowing
that it was a Trophe erected at first in honor of Maja, the
Lady of learning which they despise, vilifying the two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
universities with uncivile termes, accounting what is there
obtained by studdy is but unnecessary learning; not considering
that learninge does inable mens mindes to converse
with eliments of a higher nature then is to be found within

<p>The Seperatists, envying the prosperity and hope of the
Plantation at Ma-re Mount, (which they perceaved
beganne to come forward, and to be in a good way for gaine
in the Beaver trade,) conspired together against mine Host
especially, (who was the owner of that Plantation,) and made
up a party against him; and mustred up what aide they
could, accounting of him as of a great Monster.</p>

<p><span class="originpage"><a id="OPage_138">{138}</a></span> Many threatening speeches were given out both
against his person and his Habitation, which they
divulged should be consumed with fire: And taking advantage
of the time when his company, (which seemed little to
regard theire threats,) were gone up into the Inlands to trade
with the Salvages for Beaver, they set upon my honest host
at a place called Wessaguscus, where, by accident, they found
him. The inhabitants there were in good hope of the subvertion
of the plantation at Mare Mount, (which they principally
aymed at;) and the rather because mine host was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
man that indeavoured to advaunce the dignity of the Church
of England; which they, (on the contrary part,) would
laboure to vilifie with uncivile termes: enveying against the
sacred booke of common prayer, and mine host that used it
in a laudable manner amongst his family, as a practise of
piety.</p>

<p>There hee would be a meanes to bringe sacks to their mill,
(such is the thirst after Beaver,) and helped the conspiratores
to surprise mine host, (who was there all alone;) and they
chardged him, (because they would seeme to have some reasonable
cause against him to sett a glosse upon their mallice,)
with criminall things; which indeede had beene done by such
a person, but was of their conspiracy; mine host demaunded
of the conspirators who it was that was author of that information,
that seemed to be their ground for what they now
intended. And because they answered they would not tell
him, hee as peremptorily replyed, that hee would not say
whether he had, or he had not done as they had bin
informed.</p>

<p><span class="originpage"><a id="OPage_139">{139}</a></span> The answere made no matter, (as it seemed,)
whether it had bin negatively or affirmatively made;
for they had resolved what hee should suffer, because, (as they
boasted,) they were now become the greater number: they
had shaked of their shackles of servitude, and were become
Masters, and masterles people.</p>

<p>It appeares they were like beares whelpes in former time,
when mine hosts plantation was of as much strength as theirs,
but now, (theirs being stronger,) they, (like overgrowne
beares,) seemed monsterous. In breife, mine host must indure
to be their prisoner untill they could contrive it so that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
might send him for England, (as they said,) there to suffer
according to the merrit of the fact which they intended to
father upon him; supposing, (belike,) it would proove a hainous
crime.</p>

<p>Much rejoycing was made that they had gotten their cappitall
enemy, (as they concluded him;) whome they purposed
to hamper in such sort that hee should not be able to uphold
his plantation at Ma-re Mount.</p>

<p>The Conspirators sported themselves at my honest host,
that meant them no hurt, and were so joccund that they feasted
their bodies, and fell to tippeling as if they had obtained a
great prize; like the Trojans when they had the custody of
Hippeus pinetree horse.</p>


<p>Mine host fained greefe, and could not be perswaded
either to eate or drinke; because hee knew emptines would
be a meanes to make him as watchfull as the Geese kept in
the Roman Cappitall: whereon, the contrary part, the conspirators
would be so drowsy that hee might have an
opportunity to give them a <span class="originpage"><a id="OPage_140">{140}</a></span> slip, insteade of a tester.
Six persons of the conspiracy were set to watch him


<span class="sidenote"><i>Mine Host
got out of
prison.</i></span>

at Wessaguscus: But hee kept waking; and in the dead of
night, (one lying on the bed for further suerty,) up gets
mine Host and got to the second dore that hee was to passe,
which, notwithstanding the lock, hee got open, and shut it
after him with such violence that it affrighted some of the
conspirators.</p>

<p>The word, which was given with an alarme, was, ô he’s
gon, he’s gon, what shall wee doe, he’s gon! The rest, (halfe
a sleepe,) start up in a maze, and, like rames, ran theire heads
one at another full butt in the darke.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The Captain
tore his

<p>Theire grande leader, Captaine Shrimp, tooke on most furiously
and tore his clothes for anger, to see the empty nest,
and their bird gone.</p>

<p>The rest were eager to have torne theire haire from theire
heads; but it was so short that it would give them no hold.
Now Captaine Shrimp thought in the losse of this prize,
(which hee accoumpted his Master peece,) all his honor
would be lost for ever.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Mine host
got home to
ma-re mount.</i></div>

<p>In the meane time mine Host was got home to Ma-re
Mount through the woods, eight miles round about the head
of the river Monatoquit that parted the two Plantations,
finding his way by the helpe of the lightening, (for it thundred
as hee went terribly;) and there hee prepared powther,
three pounds dried, for his present imployement, and
foure good gunnes for him and the two assistants left at his



<span class="sidenote"><i>Hee provides
for his enemies.</i></span>

howse, with bullets of severall sizes, three hounderd or thereabouts,
to be used if the conspirators should pursue
<span class="originpage"><a id="OPage_141">{141}</a></span> him thether: and these two persons promised theire
aides in the quarrell, and confirmed that promise with
health in good rosa solis.</p>

<p>Now Captaine Shrimp, the first Captaine in the Land, (as
hee supposed,) must doe some new act to repaire this losse,
and, to vindicate his reputation, who had sustained blemish
by this oversight, begins now to study, how to repaire or survive
his honor: in this manner, callinge of Councell, they
conclude.</p>

<p>Hee takes eight persons more to him, and, (like the nine
Worthies of New Canaan,) they imbarque with preparation
against Ma-re-Mount, where this Monster of a man, as theire
phrase was, had his denne; the whole number, had the rest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
not bin from home, being but seaven, would have given Captaine
Shrimpe, (a quondam Drummer,) such a wellcome as
would have made him wish for a Drume as bigg as Diogenes
tubb, that hee might have crept into it out of sight.</p>

<p>Now the nine Worthies are approached, and mine Host
prepared: having intelligence by a Salvage, that hastened in
love from Wessaguscus to give him notice of their intent.</p>

<p>One of mine Hosts men prooved a craven: the other had
prooved his wits to purchase a little valoure, before mine
Host had observed his posture.</p>

<p><span class="originpage"><a id="OPage_142">{142}</a></span> The nine worthies comming before the Denne of
this supposed Monster, (this seaven headed hydra, as
they termed him,) and began, like Don Quixote against the



<span class="sidenote"><i>A Parly.</i></span>

Windmill, to beate a parly, and to offer quarter, if mine Host
would yeald; for they resolved to send him for England;
and bad him lay by his armes.</p>

<p>But hee, (who was the Sonne of a Souldier,) having taken
up armes in his just defence, replyed that hee would not lay
by those armes, because they were so needefull at Sea, if hee
should be sent over. Yet, to save the effusion of so much
worty bloud, as would haue issued out of the vaynes of these
9. worthies of New Canaan, if mine Host should have played
upon them out at his port holes, (for they came within danger
like a flocke of wild geese, as if they had bin tayled one
to another, as coults to be sold at a faier,) mine Host was
content to yeelde upon quarter; and did capitulate with
them in what manner it should be for more certainety,
because hee knew what Captaine Shrimpe was.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Captaine
Shrimpe promiseth
that
no violence

<p>Hee expressed that no violence should be offered to his

that hee should have his armes, and what els was requisit
for the voyage: which theire Herald retornes, it was agreed
upon, and should be performed.</p>

<p>But mine Host no sooner had set open the dore, and issued
out, but instantly Captaine Shrimpe and the rest of the worties
stepped to him, layd hold of his armes, and had
him downe: and so eagerly was every <span class="originpage"><a id="OPage_143">{143}</a></span> man bent
against him, (not regarding any agreement made with
such a carnall man,) that they fell upon him as if they would
have eaten him: some of them were so violent that they
would have a slice with scabbert, and all for haste; untill



<span class="sidenote"><i>The Worthies

an old Souldier, (of the Queenes, as the Proverbe is,) that
was there by accident, clapt his gunne under the weapons,
and sharply rebuked these worthies for their unworthy
practises. So the matter was taken into more deliberate
consideration.</p>

<p>Captaine Shrimpe, and the rest of the nine worthies,
made themselves, (by this outragious riot,) Masters of mine
Hoste of Ma-re Mount, and disposed of what hee had at his
plantation.</p>

<p>This they knew, (in the eye of the Salvages,) would add
to their glory, and diminish the reputation of mine honest
Host; whome they practised to be ridd of upon any termes,
as willingly as if hee had bin the very Hidra of the time.</p>

<p>The nine worthies of New Canaan having now the Law
in their owne hands, (there being no generall
<span class="originpage"><a id="OPage_144">{144}</a></span> Governour in the Land; nor none of the Seperation
that regarded the duety they owe their Soveraigne,
whose naturall borne Subjects they were, though
translated out of Holland, from whence they had learned to
worke all to their owne ends, and make a great shewe of Religion,
but no humanity,) for they were now to sit in Counsell
on the cause.</p>

<p>And much it stood mine honest Host upon to be very circumspect,
and to take Eacus<a name="FNanchor_491_491" id="FNanchor_491_491"></a><a href="#Footnote_491_491" class="fnanchor">[491]</a> to taske; for that his voyce was
more allowed of then both the other: and had not mine
Host confounded all the arguments that Eacus could make
in their defence, and confuted him that swaied the rest, they
would have made him unable to drinke in such manner of
merriment any more. So that following this private counsell,
given him by one that knew who ruled the rost, the
Hiracano ceased that els would split his pinace.</p>

<p>A conclusion was made and sentence given that mine
Host should be sent to England a prisoner. But when hee
was brought to the shipps for that purpose, no man durst<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
be so foole hardy as to undertake carry him.<a name="FNanchor_492_492" id="FNanchor_492_492"></a><a href="#Footnote_492_492" class="fnanchor">[492]</a> So these
Worthies set mine Host upon an Island, without gunne,



<span class="sidenote"><i>Mine host

powther, or shot or dogge or so much as a knife to get any
thinge to feede upon, or any other cloathes to shelter him
with at winter then a thinne suite which hee had one at that
time. Home hee could not get to Ma-re-Mount. Upon this
Island hee stayed a moneth at least, and was releeved by
Salvages that tooke notice that mine Host was a Sachem of
Passonagessit, and would bringe bottles of strong liquor
to him, and unite themselves <span class="originpage"><a id="OPage_145">{145}</a></span> into a league of brother
hood with mine Host; so full of humanity are these
infidels before those Christians.</p>

<p>From this place for England sailed mine Host in a Plimmouth
shipp, (that came into the Land to fish upon the
Coast,) that landed him safe in England at Plimmouth: and
hee stayed in England untill the ordinary time for shipping
to set forth for these parts, and then retorned:<a name="FNanchor_493_493" id="FNanchor_493_493"></a><a href="#Footnote_493_493" class="fnanchor">[493]</a> Noe man

<h5>THE ILLVSTRATIONS.</h5>

<p>Now to illustrate this Poem, and make the sence more
plaine, it is to be considered that the Persons at
Ma-re-Mount were seaven, and they had seaven heads and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
14. feete; these were accounted Hidra with the seaven heads:
and the Maypole, with the Hornes nailed neere the topp,
was the forked tayle of this supposed Monster, which they
(for want of skill) imposed: yet feared in time, (if they hindred
not mine Host), hee would hinder the benefit of their
Beaver trade, as hee had done, (by meanes of this helpe,) in
Kynyback river finely, ere they were awares; who, comming
too late, were much dismaide to finde that mine Host
his boate had gleaned away all before they came; which
Beaver is a fitt companion for Scarlett: and I beleeve that
Iasons golden Fleece was either the same, or some other
Fleece not of so much value.</p>

<p>This action bred a kinde of hart burning in the Plimmouth
Planters, who after sought occasion against mine
Host to overthrowe his undertakings and to destroy his
Plantation; whome they accoumpted a maine enemy to
theire Church and State.</p>

<p><span class="originpage"><a id="OPage_150">{150}</a></span> Now when they had begunne with him, they
thought best to proceede: forasmuch as they thought
themselves farre enough from any controule of Iustice, and
therefore resolved to be their owne carvers: (and the rather
because they presumed upon some incouragement they had
from the favourites of their Sect in England:) and with
fire and sword, nine in number, pursued mine Host, who
had escaped theire hands, in scorne of what they intended,
and betooke him to his habitation in a night of great
thunder and lightening, when they durst not follow him, as
hardy as these nine worthies seemed to be.</p>

<p>It was in the Moneth of Iune that these Marshallists had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
appointed to goe about this mischeifous project, and deale
so crabbidly with mine Host.</p>

<p>After a parly, hee capitulated with them about the quarter
they proffered him, if hee would consent to goe for England,
there to answere, (as they pretended,) some thing they could
object against him principall to the generall: But what it
would be hee cared not, neither was it any thing materiall.</p>

<p>Yet when quarter was agreed upon, they, contrary wise,
abused him, and carried him to theire towne of Plimmouth,
where, (if they had thought hee durst have gone to England,)
rather then they would have bin any more affronted
by him they would have dispatched him, as Captaine Shrimp
in a rage profest that hee would doe with his Pistoll, as mine
Host should set his foote into the boate. Howsoever, the
cheife Elders voyce in that place was more powerfull
than any of the rest, who concluded <span class="originpage"><a id="OPage_151">{151}</a></span> to send mine
Host without any other thing to be done to him.
And this being the finall agreement, (contrary to Shrimpe
and others,) the nine Worthies had a great Feast made, and
the furmity<a name="FNanchor_497_497" id="FNanchor_497_497"></a><a href="#Footnote_497_497" class="fnanchor">[497]</a> pott was provided for the boats gang by no
allowance: and all manner of pastime.</p>

<p>Captaine Shrimpe was so overjoyed in the performance of
this exployt, that they had, at that time, extraordinary merriment,
(a thing not usuall amongst those presisians); and
when the winde served they tooke mine Host into their
Shallop, hoysed Saile, and carried him to the Northern
parts; where they left him upon a Island.</p>

the body for that time, did hold themselves to be in duety
bound to make search for a fitting man, that might be able,
(if so neede requir’d,) to take the chardge upon him in that
place of imployment: and therefore called a Counsell of the


<span class="sidenote"><i>A Councell
called.</i></span>

whole Synagoge: amongst which company, they chose out a
man that long time had bin nurst up in the tender
bosome of the Church: one that had <span class="originpage"><a id="OPage_152">{152}</a></span> speciall gifts:
hee could wright and reade; nay, more: hee had
tane the oath of abjuration, which is a speciall stepp, yea,
and a maine degree unto perferment. Him they weane,
and out of Phaos boxe<a name="FNanchor_499_499" id="FNanchor_499_499"></a><a href="#Footnote_499_499" class="fnanchor">[499]</a> fitt him with speciall guifts of no
lesse worth: they stile him Doctor, and forth they send him
to gaine imployement and opinion.</p>

<p>What luck is it I cannot hit on his name: but I will give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
you him by a periphrasis, that you may know him when you
meete him next.</p>

<p>Hee was borne at Wrington, in the County of Somerset,
where hee was bred a Butcher. Hee weares a longe beard,
and a Garment like the Greeke that beggd in Pauls
Church.<a name="FNanchor_500_500" id="FNanchor_500_500"></a><a href="#Footnote_500_500" class="fnanchor">[500]</a> This new made Doctor, comes to Salem to congratulate:<a name="FNanchor_501_501" id="FNanchor_501_501"></a><a href="#Footnote_501_501" class="fnanchor">[501]</a>
where hee findes some are newly come from Sea,
and ill at ease.</p>

<p>He takes the patient, and the urinall: eies the State
there; finds the Crasis Syptomes, and the attomi natantes:
and tells the patient that his disease was winde, which
hee had tane by gapeing feasting over board<a name="FNanchor_502_502" id="FNanchor_502_502"></a><a href="#Footnote_502_502" class="fnanchor">[502]</a> at Sea; but hee
would quickly ease him of that greife, and quite expell the
winde. And this hee did performe, with his gifts hee had:
and then hee handled the patient so handsomely, that hee
eased him of all the winde hee had in an instant.</p>

<p>And yet I hope this man may be forgiven, if hee were
made a fitting Plant for Heaven.</p>

<p>How hee went to worke with his gifts is a question; yet
hee did a great cure for Captaine Littleworth, hee cured
him of a disease called a wife:<a name="FNanchor_503_503" id="FNanchor_503_503"></a><a href="#Footnote_503_503" class="fnanchor">[503]</a> and yet I hope this man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
may be forgiven, if shee were made a fitting plant for
heaven.</p>

<p><span class="originpage"><a id="OPage_153">{153}</a></span> By this meanes hee was allowed 4. p. a moneth,
and the chirgeon’s chest, and made Phisition generall
of Salem: where hee exercised his gifts so well, that of full
42. that there hee tooke to cure, there is not one has more
cause to complaine, or can say black’s his eie. This saved
Captaine Littleworths credit, that had truck’d away the
vittels: though it brought forth a scandall on the Country
by it: and then I hope this man may be forgiven, if they
were all made fitting plants for Heaven.</p>

<p>But in mine opinion, hee deserves to be set upon a palfrey
and lead up and downe in triumph throw new Canaan, with
a coller of Iurdans about his neck, as was one of like desert
in Richard the seconds time through the streets of London,

made them all use so much modesty about the matter for the

the Salvage a side into a corner, where (with the helpe of

over to Salem, (by the helpe of Master Charter party,<a name="FNanchor_514_514" id="FNanchor_514_514"></a><a href="#Footnote_514_514" class="fnanchor">[514]</a> the

for a time.</p>

<p>Hee, resolving to make hay whiles the Sonne did shine,
first pretended himselfe to be sent over as cheife Iustice of the
Massachussets Bay and Salem, forsoth, and tooke unto him a
councell; and a worthy one no doubt, for the Cowkeeper of
Salem was a prime man in those imployments; and to ad
a Majesty, (as hee thought,) to his new assumed dignity, hee
caused the Patent of the Massachussets, (new brought into
the Land,) to be carried where hee went in his progresse
to and froe, as an embleme of his authority: which

into the mouthes of poore silly things, that were sent alonge
with him, what skill hee had in Engines, and in things of
quaint devise: all which prooved in conclusion to be but
impostury.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Warrants
made by
Capt. Littleworth
in his
name.</i></div>

<p>This man, thinking none so worthy as himselfe, tooke
upon him infinitely: and made warrants in his owne name,
(without relation to his Majesties authority in that place,)
and summoned a generall apparance at the worshipfull towne
of Salem:<a name="FNanchor_517_517" id="FNanchor_517_517"></a><a href="#Footnote_517_517" class="fnanchor">[517]</a> there in open assembly was tendered certaine

Eager,<a name="FNanchor_518_518" id="FNanchor_518_518"></a><a href="#Footnote_518_518" class="fnanchor">[518]</a> (that had renounced his old calling to the Ministry

boxe.)<a name="FNanchor_519_519" id="FNanchor_519_519"></a><a href="#Footnote_519_519" class="fnanchor">[519]</a></p>

<p>To these Articles every Planter, old and new, must signe,

have planted them a Colony with [in] that cirquit which hee
challenged, and not contend for roome for their Cattell.
But for all that, hee that should refuse to subscribe, must
pack.</p>

<p>The tenor of the <i>Articles</i> were these: <i>That in all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
<span class="originpage"><a id="OPage_159">{159}</a></span> causes, as well Ecclesiasticall as Politicall, wee should
follow the rule of Gods word.</i></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Mine Host

not.</i></div>

<p>This made a shew of a good intent, and all the assembly,
(onely mine Host replyed,) did subscribe: hee would not,
unlesse they would ad this Caution: <i>So as nothing be done
contrary or repugnant to the Lawes of the Kingdome of England.</i>
These words hee knew, by former experience, were
necessary, and without these the same would proove a very
mousetrapp to catch some body by his owne consent, (which
the rest nothing suspected,) for the construction of the worde
would be made by them of the Seperation to serve their
owne turnes: and if any man should, in such a case, be
accused of a crime, (though in it selfe it were petty,) they
might set it on the tenter hookes of their imaginary gifts,
and stretch it to make it seeme cappitall; which was the reason
why mine Host refused to subscribe.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The Patent.</i></div>

<p>It was then agreed upon that there should be one generall
trade used within that Patent, (as hee said,) and a generall
stock: and every man to put in a parte: and every man, for
his person, to have shares alike: and for their stock, according
to the ratable proportion was put in: and this to continue
for 12. moneths, and then to call an accompt.</p>


<p>All were united, but mine Host refused: two truckmasters
were chosen; wages prefixed; onely mine Host put in a

Caviat that the wages might be paid out of the cleare
proffit, which there in black and white was plainely put
downe.</p>

<p><span class="originpage"><a id="OPage_160">{160}</a></span> But before the end of 6. moneths, the partners in
this stock, (handled by the Truckmasters,) would
have an accoumpt: some of them had perceaved that Wam<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>pambeacke
could be pocketted up, and the underlings, (that

any thinge, but what was trucked for Beaver onely.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Insteed of

<p>The accoumpt being made betweene Captaine Littleworth,
and the two Truckmasters, it was found that instead
of increasing the proffit, they had decreased it; for the
principall stock, by this imployment, was freetted so, that
there was a great hole to be seene in the very middle of it,
which cost the partners afterwards one hundred markes to
stopp and make good to Captaine Littleworth.</p>

<p>But mine Host, that sturred not his foote at all for the
matter, did not onely save his stock from such a Cancar, but
gained sixe and seaven for one: in the meane time hee
derided the Contributers for being catch’d in that snare.</p>

<p>Captaine Littleworth, (that had an akeing tooth at mine
Host of Ma-re-Mount,) devised how hee might put a
trick upon him, by colour of a Sequestration; and got some
persons to pretend that hee had corne and other
goods of theirs in possession; and the <span class="originpage"><a id="OPage_161">{161}</a></span> rather because
mine Host had store of corne and hee had improvidently
truckt his store for the present gaine of Beaver; in so
much that his people under his chardge were put to short
allowance, which caused some of them to sicken with con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>ceipt
of such useage, and some of them by the practise of the
new entertained Doctor Noddy, with his Imaginary gifts.
They sent therefore to exhibit a petition to grim Minos,
Eacus and Radamant, where they wished to have the author
of their greife to be convented:<a name="FNanchor_521_521" id="FNanchor_521_521"></a><a href="#Footnote_521_521" class="fnanchor">[521]</a> and they had procured it
quickly, if curses would have caused it: for good prayers
would be of no validity, (as they supposed,) in this extremity.</p>


<p>Now in this extremity Capt. Littleworth gave commission
to such as hee had found ready for such imployments to


<span class="sidenote"><i>Commission
for corne.</i></span>


enter in the howse at Ma-re-Mount, and, with a shallop, to
bring from thence such corne and other utensilles as in their
commission hee had specified. But mine Host, wary to prevent
eminent mischeife, had conveyed his powther and shott,
(and such other things as stood him in most steed for his present
condition,) into the woods for safety: and, whiles this
was put in practise by him, the shallop was landed and the
Commissioners entred the howse, and willfully bent against
mine honest Host, that loved good hospitality. After they had


<span class="sidenote"><i>Mine Hosts
corne &amp; goods
carried away
by violence.</i></span>

feasted their bodies with that they found there, they carried
all his corne away, with some other of his goods, contrary to
the Lawes of hospitality: a smale parcell of refuse corne
onely excepted, which they left mine Host to keepe Christmas
with.</p>

<p><span class="originpage"><a id="OPage_162">{162}</a></span> But when they were gone, mine Host fell to make
use of his gunne, (as one that had a good faculty in
the use of that instrument,) and feasted his body neverthelesse
with fowle and venison, which hee purchased with the
helpe of that instrument, the plenty of the Country and
the commodiousnes of the place affording meanes, by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>

that made his servants snap shorte in a Country so
much abounding with plenty of foode for an industrious
man, with greate variety.</p>

<p>There was a zealous Professor in the Land of Canaan,
(growne a great Merchant in the Beaver trade,) that
came over for his conscience sake, (as other men have done,)
and the meanes, (as the phrase is,) who in his minority had
bin prentice to a tombe maker; who, comming to more
ripenes of yeares, (though lesse discretion,) found a kinde of
scruple in his conscience that the trade was in parte against
the second commandement:<a name="FNanchor_529_529" id="FNanchor_529_529"></a><a href="#Footnote_529_529" class="fnanchor">[529]</a> and therefore left it off wholely,
and betooke himselfe to some other imployments.</p>


<p>In the end hee settled upon this course, where hee had
hope of preferrement, and become one of those things that

<span class="sidenote"><i>An Elder.</i></span>

any Iudas might hange himselfe upon, that is an Elder.</p>

<p>Hee had bin a man of some recconing in his time, (as
himselfe would boast,) for hee was an officer, just under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
Exchequer at Westminster, in a place called Phlegeton: there
hee was comptroller, and conversed with noe plebeians, I
tell you, but such as have angels or their attendance, (I
meane some Lawyers with appertenances, that is, Clarks,)
with whome a Iugg of Beare and a crusty rolle in the terme
is as currant as a three penny scute at Hall time.</p>

<p><span class="originpage"><a id="OPage_166">{166}</a></span> There is another place thereby, called sticks: these
are two daingerous places, by which the infernall gods
doe sweare: but this of Sticks is the more daingerous of the
two, because there, (if a man be once in,) hee cannot tell how
to get out againe handsomely.</p>

<p>I knew an under sheriff was in unawaires, and hee laboured
to be free of it: yet hee broake his back before he got so
farre as quietus est: There is no such danger in Phlegeton,
where this man of so much recconing was comptroller.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Iosua displeased.</i></div>

<p>Hee being here, waited an opportunity to be made a
gentl. and now it fell out that a gentl. newly come into the
land of Canaan, (before hee knew what ground hee stood
upon,) had incurred the displeasure of great Iosua so highly
that hee must therefore be digraded.</p>

<p>No reconciliation could be had for him: all hopes were
past for that matter: Where upon this man of much recconing
(pretending a graunt of the approach in avoydance,)
helpes the lame dogge over the stile, and was as jocund on
the matter as a Magpie over a Mutton.</p>


<p>Wherefore the Heralls, with Drums, and Trumpets, proclaiming

great Iosua, (for divers and sundry very good causes and considerations,
Master Temperwell thereunto especially mooving,)

same man againe on the top of that stile, but that
hee should stand perpetually digraded from that prerogative.
And the place by this meanes being voyde, this man, of so
much more reckoning, was receaved in like a Cypher to fill
up a roome, and was made a Gentleman of the first head;

<p>There was an honest man, one M<sup>r</sup>. Innocence Fairecloath,<a name="FNanchor_532_532" id="FNanchor_532_532"></a><a href="#Footnote_532_532" class="fnanchor">[532]</a>
by M<sup>r</sup>. Mathias Charterparty sent over into
New Canaan, to raise a very good marchantable commodity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
for his benefit; for, whiles the man was bound by covenant
to stay for a time, and to imploy such servants as did there
belong to M<sup>r</sup>. Charterparty,<a name="FNanchor_533_533" id="FNanchor_533_533"></a><a href="#Footnote_533_533" class="fnanchor">[533]</a> hee disdained the tenents of the
Seperatists: and they also, (finding him to be none,) disdained
to be imployed by a carnall man, (as they termed
him,) and fought occasion against him, to doe him a mischeife.
Intelligence was conveyed to M<sup>r</sup>. Charterparty that
this man was a member of the Church of England, and
therefore, (in their account,) an enemy to their Church and
state. And, (to the end they might have some coloure
against him,) some of them practised to get into his debte,
which hee, not mistrusting, suffered, and gave credit for such
Commodity as hee had sold at a price. When the day of
payment came, insteede of monyes, hee, being at that time
sick and weake and stood in neede of the Beaver hee had


<span class="sidenote"><i>Goode Payement.</i></span>

contracted for, hee had an Epistle full of zealous
exhortations to provide for the soule; and <span class="originpage"><a id="OPage_169">{169}</a></span> not to
minde these transitory things that perished with the
body, and to bethinke himselfe whether his conscience would
be so prompt to demaund so greate a somme of Beaver as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
had bin contracted for. Hee was further exhorted therein to
consider hee was but a steward for a time, and by all likely
hood was going to give up an accompt of his stewardship:
and therfore perswaded the creditor not to load his conscience
with such a burthen, which hee was bound by the
Gospell to ease him of (if it were possible;) and for that cause
hee had framed this Epistle in such a freindly maner to put
him in minde of it. The perusall of this, (lap’d in the paper,)
was as bad as a potion to the creditor, to see his debtor Master
Subtilety (a zealous professor as hee thought) to deride
him in this extremity, that hee could not chuse, (in admiration
of the deceipt,) but cast out these words:</p>

<p>Are these youre members? if they be all like these, I
beleeve the Divell was the setter of their Church.</p>

<p>This was called in question when M<sup>r</sup>. Fairecloath least
thought of it. Capt. Littleworth must be the man must
presse it against him, for blasphemy against the Church of
Salem: and to greate Iosua Temperwell hee goes with a

<span class="sidenote"><i>Blasphemy

bitter accusation, to have Master Innocence made an example
for all carnall men to presume to speake the least word
that might tend to the dishonor of the Church of Salem;
yea, the mother Church of all that holy Land.</p>

<p>And hee convented was before their Synagoge, where no
defence would serve his turne; yet was there none to be
seene to accuse him, save the Court alone.</p>

<p><span class="originpage"><a id="OPage_170">{170}</a></span> The time of his sicknes, nor the urgent cause,
were not allowed to be urg’d for him; but whatsoever
could be thought upon against him was urged, seeing hee
was a carnall man, of them that are without. So that it
seemes, by those proceedings there, the matter was adjudged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
before he came: Hee onely brought to heare his sentence
in publicke: which was, to have his tongue bored through;
his nose slit; his face branded; his eares cut; his body to
be whip’d in every severall plantation of their Iurisdiction;
and a fine of forty pounds impos’d, with perpetuall banishment:
and, (to execute this vengeance,) Shackles,<a name="FNanchor_534_534" id="FNanchor_534_534"></a><a href="#Footnote_534_534" class="fnanchor">[534]</a> (the Deacon
of Charles Towne,) was as ready as Mephostophiles, when
Doctor Faustus was bent upon mischeife.</p>

<p>Hee is the purser generall of New Canaan, who, (with his
whipp, with knotts most terrible,) takes this man unto the
Counting howse: there capitulates with him why hee should
be so hasty for payment, when Gods deare children must pay
as they are able: and hee weepes, and sobbes, and his handkercher
walkes as a signe of his sorrow for Master Fairecloaths
sinne, that hee should beare no better affection to the
Church and the Saints of New Canaan: and strips Innocence
the while, and comforts him.</p>

<p>Though hee be made to stay for payment, hee should not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
thinke it longe; the payment would be sure when it did
come, and hee should have his due to a doite; hee should



<span class="sidenote"><i>Notable Pay.</i></span>

not wish for a token more; And then tould it him downe
in such manner that hee made Fairecloaths Innocent back
like the picture of Rawhead and blowdy bones, and
his shirte like a <span class="originpage"><a id="OPage_171">{171}</a></span> pudding wifes aperon. In this
imployment Shackles takes a greate felicity, and glories
in the practise of it. This cruell sentence was stoped in
part by Sir Christopher Gardiner, (then present at the execution,)
by expostulating with Master Temperwell: who was
content, (with that whipping and the cutting of parte of his
eares,) to send Innocence going, with the losse of all his
goods, to pay the fine imposed, and perpetuall banishment
out of their Lands of New Canaan, in terrorem populi.</p>

<p>Loe this is the payment you shall get, if you be one of
them they terme, without.</p>

<p class="summary"><i>Of the Charity of the Seperatists.</i></p></div></div>


<p>Charity is sayd to be the darling of Religion, and is
indeed the Marke of a good Christian: But where we
doe finde a Commission for ministring to the necessity of the
Saints, we doe not finde any prohibition against casting our
bread upon the waters, where the unsanctified, as well as the
sanctified, are in possibility to make use of it.</p>

<p>I cannot perceave that the Seperatists doe allowe of helping
our poore, though they magnify their practise in contributing
to the nourishment of their Saints; For as much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
as some that are of the number of those whom they terme
without, (though it were in case of sicknesse,) upon
theire landing, when a little fresh <span class="originpage"><a id="OPage_172">{172}</a></span> victuals would
have recovered their healths, yet could they not finde
any charitable assistance from them. Nay, mine Host of
Ma-re-Mount, (if hee might have had the use of his gunne,
powther and shott, and his dogg, which were denied,) hee
doubtles would have preserved such poore helples wretches
as were neglected by those that brought them over; which



<span class="sidenote"><i>Lame charity.</i></span>


was so apparent, (as it seemed,) that one of their owne tribe
said, the death of them would be required at some bodies
hands one day, (meaning Master Temperwell.)</p>

<p>But such good must not come from a carnall man: if it
come from a member, then it is a sanctified worke; if otherwise,
it is rejected as unsanctified.</p>

<p>But when Shackles<a name="FNanchor_535_535" id="FNanchor_535_535"></a><a href="#Footnote_535_535" class="fnanchor">[535]</a> wife, and such as had husbands,
parents or freinds, happened to bee sick, mine Hosts helpe
was used, and instruments provided for him to kill fresh
vittell with, (wherein hee was industrious,) and the persons,
having fresh vittell, lived.</p>

<p>So doubtles might many others have bin preserved, but
they were of the number left without; neither will those
precise people admit a carnall man into their howses, though
they have made use of his in the like case; they are such
antagonists to those that doe not comply with them, and
seeke to be admitted to be of their Church, that in scorne
they say, you may see what it is to be without.</p>

<p>These are all publike preachers. There is amongst these

exhortation:<a name="FNanchor_539_539" id="FNanchor_539_539"></a><a href="#Footnote_539_539" class="fnanchor">[539]</a> such is their practise.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span></p>
<p>The Pastor, (before hee is allowed of,) must disclaime his
former calling to the Ministry, as hereticall; and take a new
calling after their fantasticall inventions: and then hee is
admitted to bee their Pastor.</p>

<p>The manner of disclaimeing is, to renounce his calling
with bitter execrations, for the time that hee hath heretofore

<p>And theire Pastors have this preheminence above the
Civile Magistrate: Hee must first consider of the complaint
made against a member: and if hee be disposed to

more to be said: if not; Hee delivers him over to the

an assembly that stayed his comming, in the middest of his
Iorney falls into a fitt, (which they terme a zealous meditation,)
and was 4. miles past the place appointed before hee
came to himselfe, or did remember where abouts hee went.
And how much these things are different from the actions of
mazed men, I leave to any indifferent man to judge; and
if I should say they are all much alike, they that have seene
and heard what I have done, will not condemne mee altogether.</p>

<p>Now, for as much as by the practise of theire Church every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>

more pretious then gold or pearle: and hee will teach them
the meanes how to way things of that excellent worth; that
a man would suppose hee and his auditory were to part
stakes by the scale; and the like distribution they have used
about a bag pudding.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>A Taylor.</i></div>

<p>Another, (of a more cutting disposition,) steps in his steed;
and hee takes a text, which hee divides into many parts: (to
speake truly) as many as hee list. The fag end of it hee
pares away, as a superfluous remnant.</p>

<p><span class="originpage"><a id="OPage_176">{176}</a></span> Hee puts his auditory in comfort, that hee will
make a garment for them, and teach them how they
shall put it on; and incourages them to be in love with it,
for it is of such a fashion as doth best become a Christian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
man. Hee will assuer them that it shall be armor of proffe
against all assaults of Satan. This garment, (sayes hee,) is
not composed as the garments made by a carnall man, that
are sowed with a hot needle and a burning thread; but it is
a garment that shall out last all the garments: and, if they
will make use of it as hee shall direct them, they shall be
able, (like saint George,) to terrifie the greate Dragon, error;
and defend truth, which error with her wide chaps would
devoure: whose mouth shall be filled with the shredds and
parings, which hee continually gapes for under the cutting
bourd.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>A Tapster.</i></div>

<p>A third, hee supplies the rome: and in the exercise of his
guifts begins with a text that is drawne out of a fountaine
that has in it no dreggs of popery. This shall proove unto
you, (says hee,) the Cup of repentance: it is not like unto
the Cup of the Whore of Babilon, who will make men drunk
with the dreggs thereof: It is filled up to the brim with
comfortable joyce, and will proove a comfortable cordiall to
a sick soule, sayes hee. And so hee handles the matter as
if hee dealt by the pinte and the quarte, with Nic and
Froth.<a name="FNanchor_546_546" id="FNanchor_546_546"></a><a href="#Footnote_546_546" class="fnanchor">[546]</a></p>

<p>An other, (a very learned man indeed,) goes another way
to worke with his auditory; and exhorts them to walke
upright, in the way of their calling, and not, (like
carnall men,) tread awry. And if they should <span class="originpage"><a id="OPage_177">{177}</a></span> fayle
in the performance of that duety, yet they should
seeke for amendement whiles it was time; and tells them it
would bee to late to seek for help when the shop windowes
were shutt up: and pricks them forward with a freindly
admonition not to place theire delight in worldly pleasures,
which will not last, but in time will come to an end; but
so to handle the matter that they may be found to wax
better and better, and then they shall be doublely rewarded
for theire worke: and so closes up the matter in a comfortable
manner.</p>

<p>But stay: Here is one stept up in haste, and, (being not
minded to hold his auditory in expectation of any long
discourse,) hee takes a text; and, (for brevities sake,) divides
it into one part: and then runnes so fast a fore with the
matter, that his auditory cannot follow him. Doubtles his
Father was some Irish footeman;<a name="FNanchor_547_547" id="FNanchor_547_547"></a><a href="#Footnote_547_547" class="fnanchor">[547]</a> by his speede it seemes

Pithagoras,)<a name="FNanchor_548_548" id="FNanchor_548_548"></a><a href="#Footnote_548_548" class="fnanchor">[548]</a> and so the vertue of his Fathers nimble feete<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
being infused into his braines, might make his tongue out-runne
his wit.</p>

<p>Well, if you marke it, these are speciall gifts indeede:

perswading them that it is so ridiculous.</p>

<p>This is the meanes, (O the meanes,) that they pursue:

<p>The Seperatists, (after they had burned Ma-re-Mount
they could not get any shipp to undertake the carriage
of mine Host from thence, either by faire meanes or fowle,)
they were inforced, (contrary to their expectation,) to be
troubled with his company:<a name="FNanchor_560_560" id="FNanchor_560_560"></a><a href="#Footnote_560_560" class="fnanchor">[560]</a> and by that meanes had time
to consider more of the man, then they had done of the
matter: wherein at length it was discovered that they, (by
meanes of their credulity of the intelligence given them in
England of the matter, and the false Carecter of the man,)
had runne themselves headlonge into an error, and had done
that on a sodaine which they repented at leasure, but
could not tell which way to help it <span class="originpage"><a id="OPage_181">{181}</a></span> as it stood now.
They could debate upon it and especially upon two
difficult points, whereof one must be concluded upon: If
they sent mine Host away by banishment, hee is in possibility
to survive, to their disgrace for the injury done: if they
suffer him to stay, and put him in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">statu quo prius</i>, all the
vulgar people will conclude they have bin too rashe in
burning a howse that was usefull, and count them men
unadvised.</p>

<p>So that it seemes, (by theire discourse about the matter,)
they stood betwixt Hawke and Bussard: and could not tell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
which hand to incline unto. They had founded him secretly:
hee was content with it, goe which way it would. Nay
Shackles<a name="FNanchor_561_561" id="FNanchor_561_561"></a><a href="#Footnote_561_561" class="fnanchor">[561]</a> himselfe, (who was imployed in the burning of the
howse, and therefore feared to be caught in England,) and
others were so forward in putting mine Host <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in statu quo
prius</i>, after they had found their error, (which was so apparent
that Luceus eies would have served to have found it
out in lesse time,) that they would contribute 40. shillings a
peece towards it; and affirmed, that every man according to
his ability that had a hand in this black designe should be
taxed to a Contribution in like nature: it would be done
exactly.</p>

<p>Now, (whiles this was in agitation, and was well urged by
some of those partys to have bin the upshot,) unexpected,
(in the depth of winter, when all shipps were gone out of
the land,) in comes M<sup>r</sup>. Wethercock, a proper Mariner; and,
they said, he could observe the winde: blow it high, blow it
low, hee was resolved to lye at Hull<a name="FNanchor_562_562" id="FNanchor_562_562"></a><a href="#Footnote_562_562" class="fnanchor">[562]</a> rather than incounter
such a storme as mine Host had met with: and this was a
man for their turne.</p>

<p><span class="originpage"><a id="OPage_182">{182}</a></span> Hee would doe any office for the brethren, if they
(who hee knew had a strong purse, and his conscience
waited on the strings of it, if all the zeale hee had) would
beare him out in it: which they professed they would.
Hee undertakes to ridd them of mine Host by one meanes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
or another. They gave him the best meanes they could,
according to the present condition of the worke, and letters
of credence to the favoures of that Sect in England; with
which, (his busines there being done, and his shipp cleared,)
hee hoyst the Sayles and put to Sea: since which time mine
Host has not troubled the brethren, but onely at the Counsell
table: where now Sub iudice lis est.</p>

<p class="summary"><i>Of Sir Christopher Gardiner Knight, and how hee spedd

<p>Sir Christopher Gardiner,<a name="FNanchor_563_563" id="FNanchor_563_563"></a><a href="#Footnote_563_563" class="fnanchor">[563]</a> (a Knight, that had bin a traveller
both by Sea and Land; a good judicious gentleman
in the Mathematticke and other Sciences usefull for
Plantations, Kimistry, &amp;c. and also being a practicall Enginer,)
came into those parts, intending discovery.</p>

<p>But the Seperatists love not those good parts, when they
proceede from a carnall man, (as they call every good Protestant);
in shorte time [they] had found the meanes to pick
a quarrell with him. The meanes is that they pursue to
obtaine what they aime at: the word is there, the meanes.</p>

<p>So that, when they finde any man like to proove an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>
enemy to their Church and state, then straight <span class="originpage"><a id="OPage_183">{183}</a></span> the
meanes must be used for defence. The first precept
in their Politiques is to defame the man at whom they aime,
and then hee is a holy Israelite in their opinions who can
spread that same brodest, like butter upon a loafe: no matter
how thin, it will serve for a vaile: and then this man,
(who they have thus depraved,) is a spotted uncleane leaper:
hee must out, least hee pollute the Land, and them that are
cleane.</p>

<p>If this be one of their guifts, then Machevill<a name="FNanchor_564_564" id="FNanchor_564_564"></a><a href="#Footnote_564_564" class="fnanchor">[564]</a> had as good
gifts as they. Let them raise a scandall on any, though
never so innocent, yet they know it is never wiped cleane
out: the staind marks remaines; which hath bin well
observed by one in these words of his,</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza italic">
     <div class="verse">Stick Candles gainst a Virgin walls white back;</div>
     <div class="verse">If they’l not burne yet, at the least, they’l black.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>And thus they dealt with Sir Christopher: and plotted by
all the wayes and meanes they could, to overthrow his
undertakings in those parts.</p>

<p>And therefore I cannot chuse but conclude that these
Seperatists have speciall gifts: for they are given to envy
and mallice extremely.</p>

<p>The knowledge of their defamacion could not please the
gentleman well, when it came to his eare; which would
cause him to make some reply, as they supposed, to take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>
exceptions at, as they did against Faire cloath:<a name="FNanchor_565_565" id="FNanchor_565_565"></a><a href="#Footnote_565_565" class="fnanchor">[565]</a> and this
would be a meanes, they thought, to blow the coale, and
so to kindle a brand that might fire him out of the Country
too, and send him after mine Host of Ma-re-Mount.</p>

<p>They take occasion, (some of them,) to come to his
howse when hee was gone up into the Country, and
<span class="originpage"><a id="OPage_184">{184}</a></span> (finding hee was from home,) so went to worke that
they left him neither howse nor habitation nor servant,
nor any thing to help him, if hee should retorne: but
of that they had noe hope, (as they gave it out,) for hee was
gone, (as they affirmed,) to leade a Salvage life, and for that
cause tooke no company with him: and they having considered
of the matter, thought it not fit that any such man
should live in so remoate a place, within the Compas of their
patent. So they fired the place, and carried away the persons
and goods.</p>

<p>Sir Christopher was gone with a guide, (a Salvage,) into
the inland parts for discovery: but, before hee was returned,
hee met with a Salvage that told the guide, Sir Christopher
would be killed: Master Temperwell, (who had now found
out matter against him,) would have him dead or alive.
This hee related; and would have the gentleman not to goe
to the place appointed, because of the danger that was
supposed.</p>

<p>But Sir Christopher was nothing dismaid; hee would on,
whatsoever come of it; and so met with the Salvages: and
betweene them was a terrible skermish: But they had the
worst of it, and hee scaped well enough.</p>

<p>The guide was glad of it, and learnd of his fellowes that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
they were promised a great reward for what they should doe
in this imployment.</p>

<p>Which thing, (when Sir Christopher understood,) hee gave
thanks to God; and after, (upon this occasion to sollace
himselfe,) in his table booke hee composed this sonnet, which
I have here inserted for a memoriall.</p>

tooke shipping, and disposed of himselfe for England;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>

<p class="summary"><i>Of mine Host of Ma-re-Mount how hee played Ionas after
hee had bin in the Whales belly for a time.</i></p></div></div>


<p>Mine Host of Ma-re-Mount, being put to Sea, had delivered
him, for his releefe by the way, (because the shipp
was unvitteled, and the Seamen put to straight allowance,
which could hold out but to the Canaries,) a part of his
owne provision, being two moneths proportion; in all but 3.
small peeces of porke, which made him expect to be famished
before the voyage should be ended, by all likelyhood.
Yet hee thought hee would make one good meale, before
hee died: like the Colony servant in Virginea, that, before
hee should goe to the gallowes, called to his wife to set on
the loblolly pot, and let him have one good meale before hee
went; who had committed a petty crime, that in those dayes
was made a cappitall offence.</p>

<p>And now, mine Host being merrily disposed, on went the
peeces of porke, wherewith hee feasted his body, and cherished
the poore Sailers; and got out of them what M<sup>r</sup>. Wethercock,
their Master, purposed to doe with him that hee had
no more provision: and along they sailed from place to place,
from Iland to Iland, in a pittifull wether beaten ship, where
mine Host was in more dainger, (without all question,) then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
Ionas, when hee was in the Whales belly; and it was the
great mercy of God that they had not all perished. Vittelled
they were but for a moneth, when they wayd Ancor and left
the first port.</p>

<p><span class="originpage"><a id="OPage_187">{187}</a></span> They were a pray for the enemy for want of
powther, if they had met them: besides the vessell
was a very slugg, and so unserviceable that the Master called
a counsell of all the company in generall, to have theire
opinions which way to goe and how to beare the helme, who
all under their hand affirmed the shipp to be unserviceable:
so that, in fine, the Master and men and all were at their
wits end about it: yet they imployed the Carpenters to
search and caulke her sides, and doe theire best whiles they
were in her. Nine moneths they made a shifte to use her,
and shifted for supply of vittells at all the Islands they
touched at: though it were so poorely, that all those helpes,
and the short allowance of a bisket a day, and a few Lymons
taken in at the Canaries, served but to bring the vessell in
view of the lands end.</p>

<p>They were in such a desperat case, that, (if God in his
greate mercy had not favoured them, and disposed the
windes faire untill the vessell was in Plimmouth roade,) they
had without question perished; for when they let drop an
Anchor, neere the Island of S. Michaels,<a name="FNanchor_566_566" id="FNanchor_566_566"></a><a href="#Footnote_566_566" class="fnanchor">[566]</a> not one bit of
foode left, for all that starving allowance of this wretched
Wethercock, that, if hee would have lanched out his beaver,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
might have bought more vittells in New England then he,
and the whole ship with the Cargazoun, was worth, (as the
passingers hee carried who vittelled themselves affirmed).
But hee played the miserable wretch, and had possessed his
men with the contrary; who repented them of waying
anchor before they knew so much.</p>

<p>Mine Host of Ma-re-Mount, (after hee had bin in
<span class="originpage"><a id="OPage_188">{188}</a></span> the Whales belly,) was set a shore, to see if hee
would now play Ionas, so metamorphosed with a
longe voyage that hee looked like Lazarus in the painted
cloath.</p>

<p>But mine Host, (after due consideration of the premisses,)
thought it fitter for him to play Ionas in this kinde, then
for the Seperatists to play Ionas in that kinde as they
doe. Hee therefore bid Wethercock tell the Seperatists,
that they would be made in due time to repent those
malitious practises, and so would hee too; for hee was
a Seperatist amongst the Seperatists, as farre as his wit
would give him leave; though when hee came in Company
of basket makers, hee would doe his indevoure to make
them pinne the basket, if hee could, as I have seene him.
And now mine Host, being merrily disposed, haveing past
many perillous adventures in that desperat Whales belly,
beganne in a posture like Ionas, and cryed, Repent you
cruell Seperatists, repent; there are as yet but 40. dayes, if
Iove vouchsafe to thunder, Charter and the Kingdome of the
Seperatists will fall asunder: Repent you cruell Schismaticks,
repent. And in that posture hee greeted them by
letters retorned into new Canaan; and ever, (as opportunity
was fitted for the purpose,) he was both heard and seene in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>
posture of Ionas against them, crying, repent you cruel
Seperatists, repent; there are as yet but 40. dayes; if Iove
vouchsafe to thunder, the Charter and the Kingdome of the
Seperatists will fall a sunder: Repent, you cruell Schismaticks,
repent. If you will heare any more of this proclamation
meete him at the next markettowne, for

<p><a name="Footnote_2_2" id="Footnote_2_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> A Captain Wolliston is mentioned
by Smith (<i>Description of New England</i>,
<span class="smcap lowercase">III.</span> Mass. Hist. Coll., vol. vi. p. 136) as
the lieutenant of “one Captain Barra,
an English pirate, in a small ship, with
some twelve pieces of ordnance, about
thirty men and near all starved,” whom
Smith encountered in 1615, while a captive
in the hands of the French freebooters.
Though it has found a place
in biographical dictionaries on account
of two eminent men of one family from
Staffordshire who bore it, the name of
Wollaston is rarely met with. It is not
found, for instance, in the present directories
of either Boston or New York,
and but twice in that of Philadelphia.
It has been given to islands in both the
Arctic and the Antarctic oceans, but
the family to which it belonged seems
to have originated in an inland English
county. (Lower’s <i>Patronymica Britannica</i>).
The Captain, or Lieutenant,
Wolliston, therefore, whom Smith fell
in with in 1615 may have been, and
probably was, the same who ten years
later gave his name to the hill on
Quincy Bay. It is not likely that two
Captain Wollastons were sea-adventurers
at the same time. That it actually
was the same man is, however, matter
of pure surmise.</p></div>

taken from Rev. Dr. William P. Lunt’s
<i>Two Discourses on Occasion of the Two
Hundredth Anniversary of the Gathering
of the First Congregational Church,
Quincy</i>, (p. 37). It represents the place
very accurately as it appeared in 1840,
and as it is supposed to have appeared
from the time of the first settlement until
recently. The single tree was a lofty red-cedar,
which must have been there when
Wollaston landed, as it was a large tree
of a long-lived species, and died from age
about 1850. The trunk is still (1882)
standing; and, though all the bark has
dropped off, it measures some 66 inches
in circumference. The central part of
the above cut, including the tree, has
been adopted as a seal for the town of
Quincy, with the motto “<span class="smcap">Manet</span>.”</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_30_30" id="Footnote_30_30"></a><a href="#FNanchor_30_30"><span class="label">[30]</span></a> Morton uniformly speaks of the place
as Ma-re-Mount, and John Adams on
this point commented in his notes as
follows:&mdash;“The Fathers of Plymouth,
Dorchester, Charlestown, &amp;c., I suppose
would not allow the name to be Ma-re-Mount,
but insisted upon calling it Merry-Mount,
for the same reason that the
common people in England will not call
gentlemen’s ornamental grounds gardens,
but insist upon calling them pleasure-grounds,
<i>i. e.</i>, to excite envy and
make them unpopular.”
</p>
<p>
Ma-re-Mount, however, was a characteristic
bit of Latin punning on Morton’s
part, designed to tease his more austere
neighbors. He himself says (<i>Infra</i>,
<a href="#OPage_132">*132</a>): “The inhabitants of Passonagessit,
having translated the name of their habitation
from that ancient salvage name
to Ma-re-Mount ... the precise seperatists
that lived at New Plimmouth
stood at defiance with the place threatening
to make it a woefull mount and
not a merry mount.” (<i>Infra</i>, <a href="#OPage_134">*134</a>.) In
view of the situation of the place, Ma-re-Mount
was a very appropriate name, but
it may well be questioned whether it
was ever so called by any human being
besides Morton, or by him except in
print. Bradford calls it Merie-mounte.
(p. 237.) The expression used by Morton,
that they “translated the name”
from Passonagessit to Ma-re-Mount,
would naturally suggest that the Indian
name might find its equivalent in the
Latin one, and mean simply “a hill by
the sea.” On this point, however, J.
Hammond Trumbull writes: “Morton’s
‘Passonagessit’ has been a puzzle to me
every time it has caught my eye since
I first marked it twenty years ago or
more with double (??). Morton, as he
shows in chap. ii. of book <span class="smcap lowercase">I.</span>, could not
write the most simple Indian word without
a blunder. What <i>may</i> have been
the name he makes ‘Passonagessit’ we
cannot guess, unless it survives in
some early record. There is no trace of
‘sea,’ or ‘water,’ or ‘mount’ in it. If
it stands for <i>Pasco-naig-és-it</i>, it means
‘at [a place] near the little point,’ but
I know so little of the local topography
that I hesitate to suggest this interpretation.”
The rendering here suggested by
Dr. Trumbull does apply sufficiently
well to the locality. Mount Wollaston
is a part of the neck which connects
the peninsulas locally known in Quincy
as Germantown and Hough’s Neck with

he calls them, “All of them are of a
modest demeanor, considering their savage
breeding; and indeed do shame our
<i>English</i> rusticks whose rudeness in many
things exceedeth theirs.” (<i>Two Voyages</i>,
pp. 12, 45.) When the Massachusets
Indian women, in September, 1621,
sold the furs from their backs to the first
party of explorers from Plymouth, Winslow,
who wrote the account of that expedition,
says that they “tied boughs
about them, but with great shamefacedness,
for indeed they are more modest
than some of our English women are.”
(<i>Mourt</i>, p. 59.) See also, to the same
effect, Wood’s <i>Prospect</i>, (p. 82.) It suggests,
indeed, a curious inquiry as to
what were the customs among the ruder
classes of the British females during the
Elizabethan period, when all the writers
agree in speaking of the Indian women
in this way. Roger Williams, for instance,
referring to their clothing, says:
“Both men and women within doores,
leave off their beasts skin, or English
cloth, and so (excepting their little apron)
are wholly naked; yet but few of the
women but will keepe their skin or cloth
(though loose) neare to them, ready to
gather it up about them. Custome hath
used their minds and bodies to it, and in
such a freedom from any wantonnesse
that I have never seen that wantonnesse
amongst them as, (with griefe) I have
heard of in Europe.” (<i>Key</i>, pp. 110-11.)
And he adds, “More particular:

In Parkman’s <i>Jesuits in North America</i>
(ch. iv.) there is a very graphic account
of the missionary Le Jeune’s experience
among the Algonquins, in which
he describes the interior of the wigwam
on a winter’s evening. “Heated to suffocation,
the sorcerer, in the closest possible
approach to nudity, lay on his back,
with his right knee planted upright and
his left leg crossed on it, discoursing volubly
to the company, who, on their part,
listened in postures scarcely less remote
from decency.” Le Jeune says, “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Les
filles et les jeunes femmes sont à l’exterieur
tres honnestement couvertes, mais
entre elles leurs discours sont puants,
comme des cloaques</span>;” and Parkman
adds, “The social manners of remote
tribes of the present time correspond
perfectly with Le Jeune’s account of
those of the Montagnais.” See also
<i>Voyages of Champlain</i>, Prince Soc.,
vol. iii. pp. 168-70.</p></div>

was recognized as a virtue by many
tribes.” (<i>Jesuits in North America</i>,
p. xxxiv.) Of the New England Indians
Williams remarks,&mdash;“Single fornications
they count no sin, but after
marriage then they count it heinous for
either of them to be false.” (<i>Key</i>, p. 138.)
Judging by an incident mentioned by
Morton, however, adultery does not
seem to have been looked upon as a
very grave offense among the Indians of
the vicinity in which he lived. (<i>Infra</i>,
<a href="#OPage_32">*32</a>.) On the general subject of morality
among young Indian women, especially
in the vicinity of trading-posts, see Parkman’s
<i>Jesuits in North America</i> (pp.
xxxiv, xlii) and the letter from Father
Carheil to the Intendant Champigny, in
<i>The Old Régime in Canada</i> (p. 427).</p></div>

Winnisimmet (p. 241) as one of the places
the settlers at which contributed to the
charge. They may, as Savage suggests,
(<i>Winthrop</i>, vol. i. p. *43 n.) have been
included with Blackstone, though, considering
what Maverick’s means were,
this does not seem probable. Edward
Hilton lived at Dover, eight miles above
Piscataqua. (Young’s <i>Chron. of Mass.</i>,
p. 315. <i>Proc. of Mass. Hist. Soc. 1875-6</i>,
pp. 362-8.) Mr. Deane suggests that
Little Harbor, the place formerly occupied
by Thomson, was meant by Piscataqua.
(<i>Ib.</i>, 368.) The locality of Bursley
and Jeffreys greatly confused the authorities
for a time, but it no longer seems
open to question. (<i>Proc. of Mass. Hist.

The reference here, as at some other
places, is to Deane’s chapter on “The
Charter of King Charles I.” As a rule,
in works of this description, dealing
with the sources of history, it is not
permissible to refer to contemporaneous
authorities. Mr. Deane, however, so
far as New England history is concerned,
may fairly be made an exception
to this rule. His knowledge is so
exhaustive and his accuracy so great that
a reference to him I consider just as good
and as permissible as a reference to the
original authorities.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_124_124" id="Footnote_124_124"></a><a href="#FNanchor_124_124"><span class="label">[124]</span></a> William Jeffreys was one of the Robert
Gorges Company. He had contributed
to the cost of arresting Morton in
1628 and sending him to England. Morton,
in writing to him, could not but have
been aware of this; but not improbably,
during the time of his return to Mount
Wollaston in 1630, he had seen more of
Jeffreys, and found that he too, like the
rest of the “old planters,” looked on the
Massachusetts Company with jealousy
and apprehension. At that time, indeed,
Jeffreys was in active correspondence
with Gorges, and outspoken in his complaints.
(<span class="smcap lowercase">IV.</span> <i>Mass. Hist. Coll.</i>, vol. vi.
p. 3.) Hence the familiarity of the address.
It is apparent from the letter,
however, that Morton, when he wrote it,
was so sure of his position and so elated
with a sense of his own importance that
he could not contain himself. He could
not resist the desire to let his old acquaintances
in America know what an important
personage he had become, and he
probably hoped they would show the
letter to Winthrop and every one else.
It was a childish outbreak of delight and
vanity.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_125_125" id="Footnote_125_125"></a><a href="#FNanchor_125_125"><span class="label">[125]</span></a> There is some confusion about these
dates. The letter itself is dated the 1st
of May, and the commission is here said
on that day to have passed the great seal.
The commissioners may have designated
Gorges as governor-general at this time,
and ordered a commission as such to be
at once made out to him; but a year
later the King’s intention of appointing
him was formally announced. (<i>Proc. of
Amer. Antiq. Soc.</i>, 1867, p. 120.) The
probability is that the business relating
to the colonies was regarded as of little
moment and done in the most careless
and irregular way, hardly a record even
of it being kept. Some proceedings were
thus begun and not carried out, and
other things were done twice.</p></div>

wrote to Governor Winthrop, of Sir Ferdinando,
that he was then “nere 80
yeares ould.” (<span class="smcap lowercase">IV.</span> <i>Mass. Hist. Coll.</i>, vol.
vii. p. 342.) This can hardly be correct,
however, as subsequently he served
on the royal side in the civil wars, and
was among the prisoners taken by Fairfax
when he stormed Bristol in September,
1645. (<span class="smcap lowercase">III.</span> <i>Mass. Hist. Coll.</i>, vol.
iii. p. 342.) He must, however, have
then been a very old man, as fifty-four
years before, in 1591, he had distinguished
himself at the siege of Rouen,
in Essex’s English contingent. (Devereux’s

addle-headed fellow as he represents
himself to be, could not be cordial with
the first people from Leyden, or with
those who came over with the patent,
from London or the West of England.
I can hardly conceive that his being a
Churchman, or reading his prayers from
a Book of Common Prayer, could be
any great offence. His fun, his songs
and his revels were provoking enough,
no doubt. But his commerce with the
Indians in arms and ammunition, and
his instructions to those savages in the
use of them, were serious and dangerous
offences, which struck at the lives
of the new-comers, and threatened the
utter extirpation of all the plantations.”

in the <i>Geography</i> of Peter Heylyn, London,
1674, as one of the Cape Verde
Islands. It is called in the text Insula
Salis, and on other old maps Isle of Sal,
or Ilha do Sal. There are some ten islands
in the group. Professor J. D. Whitney
writes that several islands are known
by the name of Sall, and that the one referred
to by Morton is probably that off
the north shore of Cuba. “A good deal
has been written about the poisonous
fishes of the waters about the island of
Cuba. The disease produced by eating
poisonous fish is called <i>ciguatera</i>, and the
fish itself is said to be <i>ciguato</i>. All that
is definitely known about the matter
seems to be that quite a large number
of species of fish in that region are believed
to be liable to some disease, the
nature and course of which is unknown;
and that those who eat the fish thus diseased
are themselves liable to be attacked
by the malady called <i>ciguatera</i>.”</p></div>

Hudson. Davis’s three voyages were
made in 1585-6-7, and it was in the first
of them that he discovered the straits
which bear his name. He afterwards
made five voyages to the East Indies, in
the last of which he was killed in a fight
with some Japanese on the coast of Malacca.
Hudson made four voyages between
1607 and 1610, during the last of
which he passed a winter, frozen in, near
the entrance to Hudson Bay. His crew
mutinied, and turned him adrift in an
open boat, on the 22d of July, 1610. He
was never heard of again; and it is his
“fate,” probably, which Morton had in
mind. No other noted discoverer of the
Northwest Passage was lost prior to 1634.
The discovery of that passage, however,
then excited as active an interest as it
has since, or does now. In 1632 Edward
Howes sent out to Governor Winthrop
a printed “Treatise of the North-West
Passage” (<span class="smcap lowercase">IV.</span> <i>Mass. Hist. Coll.</i>,

Phillips in Somerset, has already been
frequently referred to in the introductory
portions of this volume. Of an old
West Country family and pure English
descent, he was born about the year
1560 (<span class="smcap lowercase">IV.</span> <i>Mass. Hist. Coll.</i>, vol. vii. p.
329). He early devoted himself to a military
and naval life, and in 1591 served
under Essex at the siege of Rouen. Subsequently
he is said to have been wounded,
either at Amiens, or during the siege
of Paris by Henry IV. In consequence
of his services he was appointed by
Queen Elizabeth royal governor of Plymouth,
and in 1597 was designated as
one of the staff of Essex in the Ferrol
expedition, with the title of Sergeant-Major.
In 1601 he was concerned in
Essex’s insurrection, and was one of the
principal witnesses against the Earl at
his trial. After a considerable period of
imprisonment he was released, and, on
the accession of James I., was reappointed
governor of Plymouth. In 1605 he became
interested in American discovery
and colonization, and in 1607 he was one
of the projectors of the Popham colony
in Maine. During the next thirteen
years he was engaged in fishing and
trading ventures to New England, and
indefatigable in collecting information
as to America. (Palfrey, vol. i. p. 79.)
In 1620 he procured from James I. the
great patent of the Council for New
England. In 1623 he sent out the Robert
Gorges expedition which settled
itself at Wessagusset. (<i>Supra</i>, <a href="#Page_2">2-4</a>.)
His subsequent connection with Morton,
and his intrigues against the Massachusetts
colony and charter, have been sufficiently
referred to in this volume.
During the Civil War Gorges espoused
the royal side, and was made a prisoner
when Fairfax captured Bristol in August
1645. He died probably about the
10th of May 1647, as he was buried on
the 14th of that month.

that “Morton, as he shows in

the most simple Indian word without a
blunder.” As respects the words which
Morton believed to be Indian-Greek,
Mr. Trumbull has further kindly furnished
the following notes: “<i>En animia</i>&mdash;<i>Wunanumau</i>,
as Eliot wrote it,
signifies ‘he is well disposed, or well
minded toward another,’ or ‘is pleased
with’ him. There is another word,
nearly related, which Morton may have
had in mind, meaning ‘to help,’ ‘do a
favor to,’&mdash;<i>aninumeh</i>, ‘help me’ (Eliot),
<i>anúnime</i> (R. Williams).”</p></div>

the Indians: “The people are very ingenious
and observative; they keep account
of time by the moon, and winters
or summers; they know divers of
the stars by name; in particular they
know the north star, and call it <i>maske</i>,
which is to say, <i>the bear</i>.” (Young’s
<i>Chron. of Pilg.</i>, pp. 365-6.) See also
to the same effect, Roger Williams’s
<i>Key</i> (<i>Publications of the Narragansett
Club</i>, vol. i.) and Mr. Trumbull’s note
(p. 105). Mr. Trumbull now further
adds: “The name (<i>maske</i>) was given to
Ursa Major or Charles’s Wain, not to
the North Star; and by nearly all Algonkin
tribes. An interesting note on
this point can be found in Hopkins’s
<i>Hist. Memorials of the Housatonic Indians</i>
(p. 11), and another in Dawson’s
<i>Acadian Geology</i> (2d ed. p. 675), showing

<i>Key</i> (p. 23), says: “Wise and judicious
men, with whom I have discoursed, maintain
their [the Indians] original to be
northward from Tartaria.” The Asiatic
origin of the North American Indians
was a necessary part of the scriptural
dogma of the origin and descent of
man. It is safe, however, to assert that,
first and last, every possible theory on this
subject has been carefully elaborated.
It is not necessary, in connection with
the <i>New Canaan</i>, to enter into the discussion,
as the views of those, from St.
Gregory to Voltaire, who have taken
part in it, have been laboriously collected
by Drake in his <i>Book of Indians</i> (ch. ii.).</p></div>

name, from some time in 1625, apparently,
until his death in 1628 (<i>supra</i>,
<a href="#Page_24">24</a>). He left a widow and an only son,
who inherited the island. Originally,
Thomson seems to have been a messenger,
or possibly an agent, of the Council
for New England. In November, 1622,
a patent, covering a considerable tract of
land, was issued to him, and the next
year, he then being apparently a young
man and newly married, he came out
and established himself at Piscataqua,
whence he afterwards moved to Boston
Harbor. All that is known of Thomson

<p><a name="Footnote_229_229" id="Footnote_229_229"></a><a href="#FNanchor_229_229"><span class="label">[229]</span></a> Morton’s attempt to trace the origin
of the North American Indians from
Brutus, and the support he finds for his
theory in the resemblance of some Indian
to Greek words, there being no reason
to suppose that Brutus or the Latins
had any acquaintance with Greek, reads
like a humorous satire on the historical
methods in vogue with the writers of
his time. Until within the last century
there were two historical events, or events
assumed to be historical, to one or the
other of which it was deemed safe to
refer the origin of any modern nation.
These events were the Siege of Troy
and the Flood,&mdash;the profane and the
sacred beginnings of modern history.
Morton wrote in 1635, and his mind naturally
had recourse to the profane theory.
Fifteen years later, Milton began his
history of England, and at the outset came
in contact with Brutus. “That which we
have,” he then remarks, “of oldest seeming,
hath by the greater part of judicious
antiquaries been long rejected for a
modern fable.” He nevertheless “determined
to bestow the telling over even
of these reputed tales, ... seeing that
ofttimes relations heretofore accounted
fabulous have been after found to contain
in them many footsteps and reliques
of something true; as what we read in
poets of the flood, and giants little believed,
till undoubted witnesses taught
us that all was not feigned.” Then
passing on, he says: “After the flood,
and the dispersing of nations, as they
journeyed leisurely from the East, Gomer,
the eldest son of Japhet, and his
offspring, as by authorities, arguments
and affinity of divers names is generally
believed, were the first that peopled all
these west and northern climes.” Coming
down to Brutus and the whole progeny
of kings, and following Geoffrey of
Monmouth, Milton then recounts in detail
the marriages, voyages, adventures
and mishaps of the descendants of Æneas
until Brutus reached an “island, not yet
Britain but Albion, in a manner desert
and inhospitable; kept only by a remnant
of giants, whose excessive force and
tyranny had destroyed the rest. These
Brutus destroys,” and, after this, “in a
chosen place, builds Troja Nova, changed
in time to Trinovantum, now London.”
</p>
<p>
The superiority of Morton’s historical
method to Milton’s, or to that in use
in Milton’s time, is obvious. Accepting
the common origin, he premises that he
does <i>not</i> find that “when Brutus did
depart from Latium his whole number
went with him at once.” Accordingly,
some of them being put to sea, “<i>might</i>
encounter with a storm,” and then being
carried out of sight of land, “they <i>might</i>
sail God knoweth whether, and so <i>might</i>
be put on this coast, as well as any
other.” And hence the author is “bold
to conclude that the original of the natives
of New England may be well conjectured
to be from the scattered Trojans,
after such time as Brutus departed from
Latium.”
</p>
<p>
It would be easy to quote from many
serious productions, contemporaneous
with the <i>New Canaan</i> and a century
after it, examples of the same method
of daring historical hypothesis; a single
instance will, however, suffice. In
his history of Lynn, written in 1829, the
Rev. Alonzo Lewis says (p. 21): “The
Indians are supposed by some to be
the remnants of the long lost ten tribes
of Israel; and their existence in tribes,
the similarity of some of their customs,
and the likeness of many words in their
language, seem to favor this opinion.”
</p>
<p>
More sensible than either Thomas
Morton or Mr. Lewis, William Wood,
in writing his <i>New England’s Prospect</i>,
in 1633, remarks (p. 78), that “Some
have thought they [the Indians] might
be of the dispersed Jews, because some
of their words be near unto the Hebrew;
but by the same rule they may conclude
them to be some of the gleanings of all
nations, because they have words which
sound after the Greek, Latin, French,
and other tongues.”
</p>
<p>
There is in the <i>Magnalia</i> (book <span class="smcap lowercase">III.</span>
part iii.) a lengthy but highly characteristic
passage, in which Mather recounts
the points of resemblance which
the evangelist Eliot saw between the Indians
and “the posterity of the dispersed
and rejected Israelites.”</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_231_231" id="Footnote_231_231"></a><a href="#FNanchor_231_231"><span class="label">[231]</span></a> Leonard Peddock seems to have
been in the employment of the Council
for New England. In the records of the
Council for the 8th of November, 1622,
is the following entry: “Mr. Thomson
is ordered to pay unto Leo: Peddock
£10 towards his paynes for his last Imployments
to New England.” Subsequently,
on the 19th of the same month:
“It is ordered that a Letter be written
from the Counsell to Mr. Weston, to deliver
to Leonard Peddock, a boy Native
of New England called papa Whinett
belonging to Abbadakest, Sachem of
Massachusetts, which boy Mr Peddock
is to carry over with him” (<i>Proceedings
of the American Antiquarian Society</i>,
April, 1867, pp. 70, 74).
</p>
<p>
Andrew Weston had returned to England
in the <i>Charity</i>, leaving Wessagussett
in September, 1622 (<i>supra</i>, <a href="#Page_7">7</a>). He
would seem to have brought over the
Indian boy in question with him. From
the entry in the records of the Council
for New England, just quoted, it would
appear that Leonard Peddock was in
New England during the summer of
1622. The reference to him in the text
is additional evidence that Morton was
there at the same time, and in company
with Weston.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_232_232" id="Footnote_232_232"></a><a href="#FNanchor_232_232"><span class="label">[232]</span></a> This is undoubtedly a misprint for
Auckies, which was a sailor’s corruption
for Auks. The Great Auk (<i>Alca
impennis</i>) is probably referred to. This
bird, now supposed to be extinct, was
formerly common on the New England
coast. Audubon, writing in 1838, says:
“An old gunner, residing on Chelsea
Beach, near Boston, told me that he
well remembered the time when the
Penguins were plentiful about Nahant
and some other islands in the bay.”
(<i>Am. Ornithological Biog.</i>, vol. iv.
p. 316.) Professor Orton, alluding to this
passage, in the <i>American Naturalist</i>
(1869, p. 540), expresses the opinion
that the Razor-billed Auk was the bird
referred to; but Professor F. W. Putnam
adds, in a foot-note, that “the ‘old
hunter’ was undoubtedly correct in his
statement, as we have bones of the species
taken from the shell-heaps of Marblehead,
Eagle Hill in Ipswich, and
Plum Island.” Dr. Jeffries Wyman
found them in the shell-heaps at Cotuit.
See <i>Mem. Hist. of Boston</i>, vol. i. p. 12.
</p>
<p>
There is an elaborate paper on the
Great Auk, under the title of “The
Garefowl and its Historians,” by Professor
Alfred Newton, in the <i>Natural
History Review</i> for 1865, p. 467.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_233_233" id="Footnote_233_233"></a><a href="#FNanchor_233_233"><span class="label">[233]</span></a> Morton would seem to be mistaken
in this statement. Between 1614 and
1619 two French vessels were lost on the
Massachusetts coast. One was wrecked
on Cape Cod, and the crew, who succeeded
in getting on shore, were most
of them killed by the savages, and
the remainder enslaved in the way described
in the text. Two of these captives
were subsequently redeemed by
Captain Dermer (Bradford, p. 98). The
other vessel was captured by the savages
in Boston Bay, and burned. This is the
vessel referred to by Morton as riding at
anchor off Peddock’s Island. The circumstances
of the capture are described
in Phinehas Pratt’s narrative (<span class="smcap lowercase">IV.</span> <i>Mass.
Hist. Coll.</i>, vol. iv. pp. 479, 489). All the
crew, he says, were killed, and the ship,
after grounding, was burned. Pratt’s
statement is distinct, and agrees with
Bradford’s, that the captives among the
Indians were the survivors from the vessel
wrecked on Cape Cod, not from that
captured in Boston Bay.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_234_234" id="Footnote_234_234"></a><a href="#FNanchor_234_234"><span class="label">[234]</span></a> Pratt’s account of this survivor
among the French crew is to be found
in <span class="smcap lowercase">IV.</span> <i>Mass. Hist. Coll.</i>, vol. iv. pp. 479,
489. He says that “one of them was
wont to read much in a book (some say
it was the New Testament), and that the
Indians enquiring of him what his book
said, he told them it did intimate that
there was a people like French men that
would come into the country and drive
out the Indians.” The account given by
Mather (<i>Magnalia</i>, B. <span class="smcap lowercase">I.</span> ch. ii. § 6) is
curiously like that in the text. After
quoting the substance of Pratt’s statement
he adds: “These infidels then
blasphemously replied, ‘God could not
kill them;’ which blasphemous mistake
was confuted by a horrible and unusual
plague, whereby they were consumed in
such vast multitudes that our first planters
found the land almost covered with
their unburied carcases; and they that
were left alive were smitten into awful
and humble regards of the English by
the terrors which the remembrance of the
Frenchman’s prophecy had imprinted on
them.”
</p>
<p>
Pratt, whom Mather followed, claims
to have derived his knowledge of these
events during the winter of 1622-3 directly
from savages concerned in them.
The probability is that the tradition of
the French captive, and his book and
prophecy, was a common one among the
settlers both at Plymouth and about
Boston Bay. Pratt apparently had a
habit, as he grew old, of appropriating
to his own account many of the earlier
and more striking incidents of colonial
history. (Mather’s <i>Early New England</i>,

<p><a name="Footnote_235_235" id="Footnote_235_235"></a><a href="#FNanchor_235_235"><span class="label">[235]</span></a> The mysterious pestilence, which in
the years 1616 and 1617 swept away
the New England Indians from the Penobscot
to Narragansett Bay, is mentioned
by all the earlier writers, and its character
has recently been somewhat discussed.
There can be no doubt that it
practically destroyed the tribes, especially
the Massachusetts and the Pokanokets,
among which it raged. The former
were reduced from a powerful people,
able, it is said, to muster three thousand
warriors, to a mere remnant a few hundred
strong. The Pokanokets were in
some localities, notably at Plymouth,
actually exterminated, and the country
left devoid of inhabitants (<span class="smcap lowercase">I.</span> <i>Mass. Hist.
Coll.</i>, vol. i. p. 148; Young’s <i>Chron. of
Pilg.</i>, p. 183). Winslow gave a description
of the desolation created by this
pestilence, and of the number of the unburied
dead, very like that in the text
(Young’s <i>Chron. of Pilg.</i>, pp. 183, 206).
On this subject, see also, Bradford, pp.
102, 325; Johnson, p. 16; Wood’s <i>Prospect</i>,
p. 72; <span class="smcap lowercase">III.</span> <i>Mass. Hist. Coll.</i>, vol.
vi. p. 57.
</p>
<p>
No definite conclusion as to the nature
of this pestilence has been reached by
medical men. It has been suggested that
it was the yellow-fever (Palfrey, vol. i.
p. 99, <i>n</i>). As, however, it raged equally
in the depth of the severest winter as
in summer, this could not have been
the case (<span class="smcap lowercase">III.</span> <i>Mass. Hist. Coll.</i>, vol. vi.
p. 57; Bradford, p. 325). Other modern
medical authorities have inclined
to the opinion that it was a visitation
of small-pox (Dr. Holmes in <i>Mass.
Hist. Soc.</i>, <i>Low. Inst. Lect.</i>, 1869, p.
261; Dr. Green’s <i>Centennial Address
before the Mass. Med. Soc.</i>, June 7, 1881,
p. 12). In support of this hypothesis
Captain Thomas Dermer is quoted, who,
sailing along the coast in 1619-20, wrote
“we might perceive the sores of some
that had escaped, who described the
spots of such as usually die” (Purchas,
vol. iv. p. 1778). On the other hand,
none of the contemporaneous writers
who speak of the disease ever call it the
small-pox, though all of them were perfectly
familiar with small-pox, and a very
large portion of them probably bore its
marks. Dermer speaks of it as “the
plague.” Bradford, when the same pestilence
raged on the Connecticut, described
it as “an infectious fever.” Dr.
Fuller, the first New England physician,
then died of it (Bradford, p. 314). He
could not but have been familiar with
the small-pox and its symptoms; and it
would seem most improbable that he
should have died of that disease among
his dying neighbors, and not have known
what was killing him. Moreover, in
1633-4 the small-pox did rage among
the Indians, and Bradford, in giving a
fearfully graphic account of its ravages,
adds, “they [the Indians] fear it more
than the plague.” Josselyn also draws
the same distinction, saying (<i>Two Voyages</i>,
p. 123): “Not long before the
English came into the country, happened
a great mortality amongst [the
Indians]; especially where the English
afterwards planted, the East and Northern
parts were sore smitten by the contagion;
first by the plague, afterwards,
when the English came, by the small-pox.”
</p>
<p>
It would seem, therefore, that the pestilence
of 1616-7 was clearly not the
small-pox. More probably it was, as
Bradford says, “an infectious fever,”
or some form of malignant typhus, due
to the wretched sanitary condition of the
Indian villages, which had become over-crowded,
owing to that prosperous condition
of the tribes which Smith describes
as existing at the time of his visit to the
coast in 1614 (<span class="smcap lowercase">III.</span> <i>Mass. Hist. Coll.</i>, vol.
vi. p. 109).</p></div>

are built with poles pitcht into
the ground of a round form for most
part, sometimes square. They bind down
the tops of their poles, leaving a hole
for smoak to go out at, the rest they
cover with the bark of trees, and line
the inside of their wigwams with mats
made of rushes painted with several
colors. One good post they set up in
the middle that reaches to the hole in
the top, with a staff across before it; at
a convenient height, they knock in a
pin upon which they hang their kettle.
Beneath that they set up a broad stone
for a back which keepeth the post from
burning. Round by the walls they spread
their mats and skins where the men sleep
whilst their women dress their victuals.
They have commonly two doors, one
opening to the south, the other to the
north, and, according as the wind sets,
they close up one door with bark and
hang a deers skin or the like before the
other. Towns they have none, being
always removing from one place to another
for conveniency of food, sometimes
to those places where one sort of fish is
most plentiful, other whiles where others
are. I have seen half a hundred of their
wigwams together in a piece of ground

combination of words signifying “let
us lay on wood,” Roger Williams adds:
“This they do plentifully when they lie
down to sleep winter and summer, abundance
they have and abundance they
lay on: their fire is instead of our bed-clothes.
And so, themselves and any
that have any occasion to lodge with
them, must be content to turn often to
the fire, if the night be cold, and they
who first wake must repair the fire.”
Elsewhere he says: “God was pleased
to give me a painful, patient spirit, to
lodge with them in their filthy, smoky
holes.” See also Gookin’s <i>Indians</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">I.</span>
<i>Mass. Hist. Coll.</i>, vol. i. p. 150.
</p>
<p>
When Stephen Hopkins and Edward
Winslow were sent on their mission to
Massasoit, in June, 1621, they say of their
entertainment on the night they arrived
at his lodge: “Late it grew, but victuals
he offered none; for indeed he had
not any, being he came so newly home.
So we desired to go to rest: he layd us
on the bed with himself and his wife,
they at the one end and we at the other,
it being only planks layd a foot from the
ground, and a thin mat upon them.
Two more of his chief men, for want
of room, pressed by and upon us; so
that we were worse weary of our lodging
than of our journey.” (<i>Mourt</i>, p. 45).
Two nights of this entertainment sufficed
for the embassadors who “feared
we should either be light-headed for
want of sleep, for what with bad lodging,
the savages barbarous singing, (for
they use to sing themselves asleep,)
lice and fleas within doors, and musketos
without, we could hardly sleep all
the time of our being there.” (<i>Ib.</i>, p. 46)
Another observer remarked of the New
England Indians: “Tame cattle they
have none, excepting Lice, and Dogs of
a wild breed” (Josselyn’s <i>Voyages</i>, p.
127); and to the same effect Roger
Williams notes (<i>Key</i>, p. 74): “In middle
of summer, because of the abundance of
fleas, which the dust of the house breeds,
they [the Indians] will fly and remove
on a sudden to a fresh place.”
</p>
<p>
Smith, describing the Virginia Indians,
says (<i>True Travels</i>, vol. i. p.
130): “Their houses are built like our
arbors, of small young springs bowed and
tyed, and so close covered with mats, or
the barkes of trees very handsomely, that
nothwithstanding either winde, raine, or
weather, they are as warm as stoves,
but very smoaky, yet at the toppe of the
house there is a hole made for the smoake
to go into right over the fire.
</p>
<p>
“Against the fire they lie on little
hurdles of Reeds covered with a mat,
borne from the ground a foote and more
by a hurdle of wood. On these round
about the house they lie heads and points,
one by the other, against the fire, some
covered with mats, some with skins, and
some stark naked lie on the ground, from
six to twenty in a house.”
</p>
<p>
In Parkman’s <i>Jesuits in North America</i>
there is a lively account of Le Jeune’s
experience in passing the winter of 1633-4
among the Algonquins: “Put aside
the bear-skin, and enter the hut. Here,
in a space some thirteen feet square, were
packed nineteen savages, men, women
and children, with their dogs, crouched,
squatted, coiled like hedge-hogs, or lying
on their backs, with knees drawn up
perpendicularly to keep their feet out of
the fire.... The bark covering was full
of crevices, through which the icy blasts
streamed in upon him from all sides; and
the hole above, at once window and
chimney, was so large, that, as he [Le
Jeune] lay, he could watch the stars as
well as in the open air. While the fire
in the midst, fed with fat pine-knots,
scorched him on one side, on the other
he had much ado to keep himself from
freezing. At times, however, the crowded
hut seemed heated to the temperature
of an oven. But these evils were light
when compared to the intolerable plague
of smoke. During a snow-storm, and
often at other times, the wigwam was
filled with fumes so dense, stifling, and
acrid, that all its inmates were forced
to lie flat on their faces, breathing
through mouths in contact with the cold
earth. Their throats and mouths felt
as if on fire; their scorched eyes streamed
with tears.... The dogs were not an
unmixed evil, for by sleeping on and
around [Le Jeune], they kept him warm
at night; but, as an offset to this good
service, they walked, ran and jumped
over him as he lay” (pp. 27-8).</p></div>

stranger or mere acquaintance; counting
it a great discourtesie not to eat of
their high conceited delicates, and sup
of their un-oat-meal’d broth, made thick
with fishes, fowles and beasts boiled
all together; some remaining raw, the
rest converted by over-much seething to
a loathed mass, not halfe so good as
<i>Irish Boniclapper</i>.” See also Gookin’s
<i>Indians</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">I.</span> <i>Mass. Hist. Coll.</i>, vol. i. p.

</p>
<p>
So also Roger Williams (<i>Key</i>, ch. ii.
and iii.): “If any stranger came in,
they presently give him to eat of what
they have; many a time, and at all times
of the night (as I have fallen in travel,
upon their houses) where nothing hath
been ready, have themselves and their
wives, risen to prepare me some refreshing.”
</p>
<p>
“In Summer-time I have knowne
them lye abroad often themselves, to
make room for strangers, English, or
others.”

Indian game of foot-ball: “Their goals
be a mile long placed on the sands,
which are as even as a board; their
ball is no bigger than a hand-ball, which
sometimes they mount in the air with
their naked feet, sometimes it is swayed
by the multitude; sometimes also it is
two days before they get a goal; then
they mark the ground they win, and
begin the next day.... Though they
play never so fiercely to outward appearance,
yet anger-boiling blood never
streams in their cooler veins; if any
man be thrown, he laughs out his foil,
there is no seeking of revenge, no quarrelling,
no bloody noses, scratched faces,
black eyes, broken shins, no bruised
members or crushed ribs, the lamentable
effects of rage; but the goal being
won, the goods on the one side lost;
friends they were at the foot-ball, and
friends they must meet at the kettle.”

<i>New England’s Prospect</i> (p. 70). In regard
to the time when this work was
written and published, see Mr. Deane’s
preface to the edition in the publications
of the Prince Society. Morton makes
numerous references to it in the <i>New
Canaan</i> (<i>infra</i>, <a href="#OPage_38">*38</a>, <a href="#OPage_53">53</a>, <a href="#OPage_64">64</a>, <a href="#OPage_84">84</a>, <a href="#OPage_99">99</a>).
The present reference is one of the few
unintelligible passages in the book.
Wood’s language, to which Morton apparently
takes exception, is as follows:
“As it is natural to all mortals to worship
something, so do these people; but
exactly to describe to whom their worship
is chiefly bent, is very difficult;
they acknowledge especially two, Ketan,
who is their good God, to whom they
sacrifice after their garners be full with a
good crop: upon this God likewise they
invocate for fair weather, for rain in time
of drought, and for the recovery of their
sick; but if they do not hear them, then
they verify the old verse, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Flectere si
nequeo Superes, Acheronta movebo</i>, their
Pow-wows betaking themselves to their
exorcisms and unromantick charms ...
by God’s permission, through the Devil’s
help, their charms are of force to produce
effects of wonderment.” Morton
would seem to have wished to depreciate
Wood, as an authority on New England,
and so, playing upon his name and the
title of his book, he implied that he had
taken a much more elevated view of the
religious development of the Indians
than could be justified either by the actual
facts, or the judgment of the best
informed.

of Sir William Alexander which have

Mourt, says: “They [the savages] are a

The subject of the religion of the North
American aborigines has been treated by
Parkman in the introduction to the <i>Jesuits
in North America</i> (pp. lxvii.-lxxxix.),
and he concludes that “the primitive Indian,
yielding his untutored homage to
an All-pervading grand Omnipotent Spirit,
is a dream of poets, rhetoricians and sentimentalists.”
To the same effect Palfrey,
at the close of his vigorous discussion
of the same subject (vol. i. p. 45),
declares that the devout Indian of the
“untutored mind is as fabulous as the
griffin or the centaur.”</p></div>

Wood’s description of the Indian apparel
is very like Morton’s. He says,
however: “The chiefe reasons they render
why they will not conforme to our
English apparell are because their women
cannot wash them when they be soyled,
and their meanes will not reach to buy
new when they have done with their old;
and they confidently beleeve, the English
will not be so liberall as to furnish them
upon gifture: therefore they had rather
goe naked than be lousie, and bring their
bodies out of their old tune, making them
more tender by a new acquired habit,
which poverty would constrain them to
leave.” (<i>Prospect</i>, p. 56).
</p>
<p>
The description given by Winslow
(Young’s <i>Chron. of Pilg.</i>, p. 365) is very
similar to Morell’s. See also Gookin’s
<i>Indians</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">I.</span> <i>Mass. Hist. Coll.</i>, vol. i. p.
152; Josselyn’s <i>Two Voyages</i>, pp. 128-9,
and Williams’s <i>Key</i>, ch. xx.
</p>
<p>
Smith (<i>True Travels</i>, vol. i. p. 129)
says: “For their apparell, they are
sometimes covered with the skinnes of
wilde beasts, which in winter are dressed
with the hayre, but in Sommer without.
The better sort use large mantels of
Deare skins, not much differing in fashion
from the Irish mantels. Some imbrodered
with white beads, some with
copper, others painted after their manner.
But the common sort have scarce
to cover their nakednesse, but with grasse,
the leaves of trees or such like. We have
seene some use mantels made of Turkey
feathers so prettily wrought and woven
with threads that nothing could be discerned
but the feathers.”</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_248_248" id="Footnote_248_248"></a><a href="#FNanchor_248_248"><span class="label">[248]</span></a> Speaking of a ceremony common to
the Algonquins and the Hurons, of propitiating
their fishing-nets by formally
marrying them every year to two young
girls, Parkman says: “As it was indispensable
that the brides should be virgins,
mere children were chosen” (<i>The
Jesuits in North America</i>, p. lxix. <i>note</i>).
The subject of female chastity among
the Indians has already been referred to
(<i>supra</i>, p. <a href="#Page_17">17</a>), and it is extremely questionable
whether they had any conception
of it. Winslow, in his <i>Good News</i>
(Young’s <i>Chron. of Pilg.</i>, p. 364) says:&mdash;“When
a maid is taken in marriage,
she first cutteth her hair, and after weareth
a covering on her head, till her hair
be grown out. Their women are diversely
disposed; some as modest, as
they will scarce talk one with another
in the company of men, being very
chaste also; yet others seem light, lascivious,
and wanton.... Some common
strumpets there are, as well as
in other places; but they are such as
either never married, or widows, or put
away for adultery; for no man will keep
such an one to wife.” Strachey (<i>Historie</i>,
p. 65), says of the Virginians:
“Their younger women goe not shadowed
[clothed] amongst their owne companie,
until they be nigh eleaven or
twelve returnes of the leafe old, nor are
they much ashamed thereof, and therefore
would the before remembered Pochahuntas,
a well featured, but wanton
yong girle, Powhatan’s daughter, sometymes
resorting to our fort, of the age
then of eleven or twelve yeares, get the
boyes forth with her into the markett
place, and make them wheele, falling on
their hands, turning up their heeles upwards,
whome she would followe, and
wheele so her self, naked as she was, all
the fort over; but being over twelve
yeares, they put on a kind of semecinctum
lethern apron (as doe our artificers or
handycrafts men) before their bellies,
and are very shamefac’t to be seen bare.”
Ellis, in his <i>Red Man and White Man</i>
(p. 185), remarks on this point: “The
obscenity of the savages is unchecked in
its revolting and disgusting exhibitions.
Sensuality seeks no covert.”
</p>
<p>
Under these circumstances it is unnecessary
to say that Morton’s statements as
to the red cap and the Sachem’s privilege
are pure fiction, and what Parkman
says of the Hurons is probably true of
the Massachusetts,&mdash;their women were
wantons before marriage and household
drudges after it. (<i>Jesuits in North
America</i>, p. xxxv).</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_249_249" id="Footnote_249_249"></a><a href="#FNanchor_249_249"><span class="label">[249]</span></a> To the same effect Roger Williams
says: “Most of them count it a shame
for a woman in travell to make complaint,
and many of them are scarcely
heard to groane. I have often known in
one quarter of an hour a woman merry
in the house, and delivered and merry
again: and within two dayes abroad, and
after foure or five dayes at worke.”
(<i>Key</i>, ch. xxiii.). See also Josselyn’s
<i>Two Voyages</i>, p. 127. Wood’s account
is almost as comprehensive, though not
quite so detailed and graphic as Josselyn’s:
“They likewise sew their husband’s
shooes, and weave mats of Turkie
feathers; besides all their ordinary
household drudgery which dayly lies
upon them, so that a bigge belly hinders
no businesse nor a childbirth takes much
time, but the young infant being greased
and footed, wrapped in a Beaver skin,
bound to his goode behaviour with his
feete up to his bumme, upon a board two
foot long and one foot broade, his face
exposed to all nipping weather, this little
<i>Pappouse</i> travels about with his bare-footed
mother, to paddle in the Icie
Clammbanks after three or four daies
of age have sealed his passe-board and
his mother’s recovery.” (<i>Prospect</i>, p.
82). See also Young’s <i>Chron. of Pilg.</i>,
p. 358.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_250_250" id="Footnote_250_250"></a><a href="#FNanchor_250_250"><span class="label">[250]</span></a> The idea that the Indian was born
white was very commonly entertained
in the first half of the seventeenth century.
Lechford, in his <i>Plaine Dealing</i>,
says (p. 50): “They are of complexion
swarthy and tawny; their children are
borne white, but they bedaube them with
oyle, and colours, presently.” Josselyn
also speaks of the Indians “dying
[their children] with a liquor of boiled
Hemlock-Bark” (<i>Two Voyages</i>, p. 128).
Speaking of the Virginia women, Smith
says: “To make [their children] hardie,
in the coldest mornings they them wash
in the rivers, and by paynting and oyntments
so tanne their skinnes, that after
a year or two, no weather will hurt
them.” (<i>True Travels</i>, vol. i. p. 131).
Strachey gives a more particular account
of the supposed process: The Indians
“are generally of a cullour browne or
rather tawny, which they cast themselves
into with a kind of arsenick stone, ...
and of the same hue are their women;
howbeit, yt is supposed neither of them
naturally borne so discouloured; for Captain
Smith (lyving somtymes amongst
them) affirmeth how they are from the
womb indifferent white, but as the men,
so doe the women, dye and disguise themselves
into this tawny cowler, esteeming
yt the best beauty to be neerest such a
kynd of murrey as a sodden quince is
of (to liken yt to the neerest coulor I
can), for which they daily anoint both
face and bodyes all over with such a
kind of fucus or unguent as can cast
them into that stayne.” (<i>Historie</i>, p. 63).</p></div>

exemption from physical deformities,
this was probably not the effect of
any peculiar congenital force or completeness,
but of circumstances which
forbade the prolongation of any imperfect
life. The deaf, blind or lame child
was too burdensome to be reared, and
according to a savage estimate of usefulness

would not requite its nurture.” Palfrey,

(<i>nanwetue</i>, Cotton), ‘a bastard.’
<i>Titta</i> should be <i>tatta</i>, a word common
among Indians, which is well
enough translated by Morton. Eliot
renders it ‘I know not,’ and R. Williams
adds to this meaning, ‘I cannot tell; it
may be so.’
</p>
<p>
“<i>Cheshetue</i> is unknown to me, but
I am inclined to believe that Morton
heard something like it, in the connection

led him to a different conclusion:
“Their affections, especially to their
children, are very strong.... This extreme
affection, together with want of
learning, makes their children saucie,
bold and undutifull. I once came into
a house, and requested some water to
drink; the father bid his sonne (of
some 8 yeeres of age) to fetch some
water: the boy refused, and would not
stir; I told the father, that I would correct
my child, if he should so disobey
me &amp;c. Upon this the father took up
a sticke, the boy another, and flew at
his father: upon my persuasion, the
poore father made him smart a little,
throw down his stick, and run for water,
and the father confessed the benefits of
correction, and the evill of their too indulgent
affections.” (<i>Key</i>, ch. v.)
</p>
<p>
To the same effect Champlain wrote
(<i>Voyages</i>, vol. iii. p. 170): “The children
have great freedom among these
tribes. The fathers and mothers indulge
them too much, and never punish
them. Accordingly they are so bad
and of so vicious a nature, that they
often strike their mothers and others.
The most vicious, when they have
acquired the strength and power, strike
their fathers. They do this whenever
the father or mother does anything that
does not please them. This is a sort
of curse that God inflicts upon them.”
Winslow, on the other hand, in his <i>Good
News</i>, lends some support to Morton’s
statement in the text. He says: “The
younger sort reverence the elder, and
do all mean offices, whilst they are
together, although they be strangers.”
(Young’s <i>Chron. of Pilg.</i>, p. 363.)</p></div>

better known by the name of Passaconaway.
There is quite an account of
him in Drake’s <i>Book of the Indians</i>
(B. <span class="smcap lowercase">III.</span> ch. vii). He is the Pissacannawa
mentioned by Wood in his <i>Prospect</i>
(p. 70), of whom the savages reported
that he could “make the water
burn, the rocks move, the trees dance,
metamorphize himself into a flaming
man.” Morton says of the Indian conjurers,
“some correspondency they have
with the Devil out of all doubt;” Wood,
to the same effect, remarks that “by
God’s permission, through the Devil’s
helpe, their charmes are of force to produce
effects of wonderment;” Smith
declares of the Indians, “their chiefe
God they worship is the Devil” (<i>True

that it was the devil who seduced
the first inhabitants of America into it
(<i>Magnalia</i>, B. <span class="smcap lowercase">I.</span> ch. i. § 3), and Winthrop,
describing the great freshet of

(<i>supra</i>, p. <a href="#Page_150">150</a>, <i>note</i>), dwelt at a place
called Pennakook, and his dominions extended
over the sachems living upon the
Piscataqua and its branches. The young
Sachem of Saugus was named Winnepurkitt,
and was commonly known
among the English as George Rumney-marsh.
He was a son of Nanepashemet,
and at one time proprietor of Deer
Island in Boston Harbor. (Drake’s <i>Book
of the Indians</i>, ed. 1851, pp. 105, 111,
278.) The incident in the text has been
made the subject of a poem, <i>The Bridal
of Pennacook</i>, by Whittier, and Drake
repeats it; but as Winnepurkitt is said
by Drake to have been born in 1616, and
to have succeeded Montowampate as
Sachem in 1633, and as Morton, at the
close of the present chapter, declares that
“the lady, when I came out of the
country [in 1630], remained still with her
father,” the whole story would seem to be
not only highly inconsistent with what
we know of Indian life and habits, but
also at variance with facts and dates.</p></div>

wampum is written, more than any
other which has come down to us, in the
spirit of the <i>New Canaan</i>: “Their Merchandize
are their beads, which are their
money, of these there are two sorts, blew
Beads and white Beads, the first is their
Gold, the last their Silver, these they
work out of certain shells so cunningly
that neither <i>Jew</i> nor Devil can counterfeit,
they dril them and string them, and
make many curious works with them to
adorn the persons of their Sagamores
and principal men and young women, as
Belts, Girdles, Tablets, Borders for their
womens hair, Bracelets, Necklaces, and
links to hang in their ears. Prince
<i>Phillip</i>, a little before I came for England,
coming to Boston, had a coat on
and Buskins set thick with these Beads
in pleasant wild works, and a broad belt
of the same; his Accoutrements were
valued at Twenty pounds. The English
Merchant giveth them ten shillings a
fathom for their white, and as much
more or near upon for their blew beads.”
(<i>Two Voyages</i>, pp. 142-3.)
</p>
<p>
There is a much better description of
wampum in Lawson’s account of Carolina,
quoted by Drake (<i>Book of the Indians</i>,
p. 328), in which he says that
wampum was current money among the
Indians “all over the continent, as far
as the bay of Mexico.” Lawson’s explanation
of the fact that wampum was
not counterfeited to any considerable
extent is much more natural than Morton’s.
It cost more to counterfeit it than
it was worth. “To make this <i>Peak</i>
it cost the English five or ten times as
much as they could get for it; whereas
it cost the Indians nothing, because they
set no value upon their time, and therefore
have no competitors to fear, or that
others will take its manufacture out of
their hands.”
</p>
<p>
Roger Williams (<i>Key</i>, ch. xxvi.) devotes
considerable space to this subject,
and says: “They [the Indians] hang
these strings of money about their necks
and wrists; as also upon the necks and
wrists of their wives and children. They
make [girdles] curiously of one, two,
three, foure and five inches thickness and
more, of this money which (sometimes
to the value of ten pounds and more)
they weare about their middle and as a
scarfe about their shoulders and breasts.
Yea, the Princes make rich Caps and
Aprons (or small breeches) of these
Beads thus curiously strung into many
formes and figures: their blacke and
white finely mixt together.” See also
Trumbull’s notes in his edition of the
<i>Key</i>, and Palfrey, vol. i. p. 31. Parkman
(<i>Jesuits in North America</i>, pp. xxxi.,
lxi.) says of wampum: “This was at
once their currency, their ornament, their
pen, ink and parchment.” He describes
the uses to which it was put among the
Hurons and Iroquois, but adds: “The
art [of working it] soon fell into disuse,
however; for wampum better than their
own was brought them by the traders,
besides abundant imitations in glass and
porcelain.”</p></div>

(<i>Two Voyages</i>, p. 143.) “Spart,” Mr.
Trumbull writes, “was a northern English

‘spart’ in the glossaries) for osiers, and
I <i>guess</i>, Morton’s and Josselyn’s <i>sparke</i>
is another form of that name.” Gookin
says (<span class="smcap lowercase">I.</span> <i>Mass. Hist. Coll.</i>, vol. i. p. 151):
“Some of their baskets are made of
rushes; some, of bents; others, of maize-husks;

“Their corn being ripe, they gather it,
and drying it hard in the Sun, conveigh
it to their barnes, which be great holes
digged in the ground in forme of a
brasse pot, seeled with rinds of trees,
wherein they put their corne, covering
it from the inquisitive search of their
gurmundizing husbands, who would eate
up both their allowed portion, and reserved
seed, if they knew where to finde
it. But our hogges having found a way
to unhindge their barne doores, and
robbe their garners, they are glad to
implore their husbands helpe to roule
the bodies of trees over their holes, to
prevent these pioneers, whose theevery
they as much hate as their flesh.”
(<i>Prospect</i>, p. 81.) Mather also, in enumerating
the points of resemblance between
the Indians and the Israelites,
(<i>Magnalia</i>, B. <span class="smcap lowercase">III.</span> part iii.) says: “They
have, too, a great unkindness for our
<i>swine</i>; but I suppose that is because
the hogs devour the clams, which are
a dainty with them.”</p></div>

assertions in question. In fact, as there
were no Spaniards in Canada, and likely
to be none on French vessels going there,
Indians of those parts would hardly have
the opportunity of distinguishing between
them by smell or otherwise. Indeed,
they did not know the existence of
such a nation.”</p></div>

their good god.’ Roger Williams
in a letter to Thomas Thorowgood, 1635,
names ‘their god Kuttand to the south-west’

<p><a name="Footnote_275_275" id="Footnote_275_275"></a><a href="#FNanchor_275_275"><span class="label">[275]</span></a> Roger Williams says: “They will
relate how they have it from their
Fathers, that Kantántowwit made one
man and woman of a stone, which disliking,
he broke them in pieces, and made
another man and woman of a tree, which
were the Fountaines of all mankind.”
(<i>Key</i>, ch. xxi.)
</p>
<p>
“They believe that the soules of men
and women goe to the Sou-west, their
great and good men and women to Cantántowwit
his House, where they have
hopes (as the Turks have) of carnal
Joyes: Murtherers, theeves and Lyers,
their souls (say they) wander restlesse
abroad.” (<i>Ib.</i>)
</p>
<p>
Wood, enlarging on this, says: “Yet
do they hold the immortality of the
never-dying soul, that it shall passe to the
South-west <i>Elysium</i>, concerning which
their <i>Indian</i> faith jumps much with
the <i>Turkish Alchoran</i>, holding it to be
a kind of Paradise, wherein they shall
everlastingly abide, solacing themselves
in odoriferous Gardens, fruitfull corn-fields,
green meadows, bathing their
hides in the coole streams of pleasant
Rivers, and shelter themselves from
heat and cold in the sumptuous Pallaces
framed by the skill of Natures curious
contrivement. Concluding that neither
care nor pain shall molest them but that
Natures bounty wil administer all things
with a voluntary contribution from the
overflowing storehouse of their <i>Elysian</i>
Hospital, at the portall whereof they
say lies a great Dog, whose churlish
snarlings deny a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pax intrantibus</i> to unworthy
intruders.” (<i>Prospect</i>, p. 79.)
</p>
<p>
Parkman says: “The primitive Indian
believed in the immortality of the soul,
but he did not always believe in a state
of future reward and punishment.”
(<i>Jesuits in North America</i>, p. lxxx.)
Referring to a case in which one of the
Jesuits quoted an Indian as saying
“there was no future life,” Parkman
adds: “It would be difficult to find another
instance of the kind.”
</p>
<p>
The romantic view of the Indian on
this point was taken by Arnold, in his
<i>History of Rhode Island</i> (vol. i. p. 78),
and the realistic view by Palfrey, in his
<i>New England</i> (vol. i. p. 49); and,
though writing at the same time, the
two seem to be controverting each other.

just quoted (<i>supra</i>, <a href="#Page_168">168</a>, <i>note</i>), speaks
of the future punishment supposed,
among the New England Indians, to be
allotted to thieves and liars. Josselyn,
on the other hand, describes them as
“very fingurative or theevish” (<i>Two Voyages</i>,
p. 125); and Gookin says: “They
are naturally much addicted to lying
and speaking untruth: and unto stealing,
especially from the English” (<span class="smcap lowercase">I.</span> <i>Mass.
Hist. Coll.</i>, vol. i. p. 149). Winslow
describes the severe punishments inflicted
for theft (Young’s <i>Chron. of Pilg.</i>,
p. 364). Dodge, in his <i>Wild Indians</i>
(pp. 63-5), explains this discrepancy in
the authorities. He says: “All these
authors are both right and wrong. In
their own bands, Indians are perfectly
honest.... It [theft] is the sole unpardonable
crime among Indians.” He
then describes, like Winslow, the severity
of the punishments inflicted for thefts;
“but,” he adds, “this wonderfully exceptional
honesty extends no further
than to the members of his immediate
band. To all outside of it, the Indian
is not only one of the most arrant
thieves in the world, but this quality or
faculty is held in the highest estimation.”</p></div>

that at my late comming forth of the Countrey,
the chiefe and most aged peaceable
Father of the countrey, Caunoŭnicus,
having buried his sonne, he burned
his owne Palace, and all his goods in it,
(amongst them to a great value) in a
sollemne remembrance of his sonne, and
in a kind of humble Expiation to the
Gods, who, (as they believe) had taken
his sonne from him.” (Williams’s <i>Key</i>,
ch. xxxii.) In the same passage Williams
says: “Upon the Grave is spread the Mat
that the party died on, the Dish he ate
in, and, sometimes, a faire Coat of skin
hung upon the next tree to the Grave,
which none will touch, but suffer it there
to rot with the dead.” See also Young’s

<p>
“In times of general Mortality they
omit the Ceremonies of burying, exposing
their dead Carkases to the Beasts of
prey. But at other times they dig a Pit
and set the diseased therein upon his
breech upright, and, throwing in the
earth, cover it with the sods and bind
them down with sticks, driving in two
stakes at each end; their mournings
are somewhat like the howlings of the
Irish, seldom at the grave but in the
Wigwam where the party dyed, blaming
the Devil for his hard-heartedness, and
concluding with rude prayers to him to
afflict them no further.” (Josselyn, <i>Two
Voyages</i>, p. 132.) There is a highly
characteristic passage to the same effect
in Wood’s <i>Prospect</i>, p. 79.</p></div>

French, and Spaniards, came to dwell
in America: which nations, especially
the English in New-England, have cause

cause these Indians to commit this great
evil and beastly sin of drunkenness.”

</p>
<p>
In regard to the peculiarities of Indian
drunkenness, see Dodge’s <i>Wild
Indians</i>, pp. 333-5. What is there
said of the Indians of “the plains” is
probably true of all the northern American
Indians. “This passion for intoxication
amounts almost to an insanity....
To drink liquor as a beverage,
for the gratification of taste, or for the
sake of pleasurable conviviality, is something
of which the Indian can form no
conception. His idea of pleasure in
the use of strong drink is to get drunk,
and the quicker and more complete that
effect, the better he likes it.”</p></div>

the Indians and the devil have
been referred to in a previous note,

curious fact that the aboriginal
hierarchy, suggested in the text, had a
few years before found its exact political
counterpart in the talk of the English
people. “‘Who governs the land?’
it was asked. ‘Why, the King.’ ‘And
who governs the King?’ ‘Why, the
Duke of Buckingham.’ ‘And who governs
the Duke?’ ‘Why, the Devil.’”

been indebted to Professors Asa Gray
and C. S. Sargent of Harvard University
for assistance, they having sent me
several of the more technical notes. This
and the five following chapters of the
<i>New Canaan</i> have a certain interest as
being among the earliest memoranda on
the trees, animals, birds, fish and geology
of Massachusetts. The only earlier
publication of at all a similar character is
Wood’s <i>New England’s Prospect</i>, which
appeared in 1634, and contained the result
of observations made during the four
years 1629 to 1633. Morton’s acquaintance
with the country was earlier and
longer than Wood’s, but the <i>New Canaan</i>
was not published until three years
after the <i>Prospect</i>, which it followed
closely in its description of the country
and its products. Josselyn’s first voyage
was made in 1638, and his stay in New
England covered a period of fifteen
months, July, 1638, to October, 1639. His
second visit was in 1663, and lasted until
1671. The <i>New England’s Rarities</i> was
published in 1672, and the <i>Two Voyages</i>
in 1674. Josselyn’s alone of these works
can make any pretence to a scientific
character or nomenclature, but the four
taken together constitute the whole body
of early New England natural history
and geology. Only occasional reference
to this class of subjects is found in other
writers.</p></div>

of hemp in New England, as evidence

high and tenne foote and a halfe.”
Thomas Wiggin, also, in writing of
New England in November, 1632, says:
“As good hempe and fflax as in any
parte of the world, growes there naturally.”
(<span class="smcap lowercase">III.</span> <i>Mass. Hist. Coll.</i>, vol. viii.
p. 322.) Hemp, however, is not native
to New England or America. That
spoken of must have been grown from
seed brought over by the colonists.
Morton may have seen it growing in
garden soil at Plymouth and Wessagusset,
but that any field of it ever reached
a height of ten or ten and a half feet
in eastern Massachusetts is very questionable.</p></div>

has furnished me the following note
on this chapter:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
“Unlike Josselyn, the author evidently
was not an herbalist, and wrote at random.
His pot-marjoram, thyme and
balm, though not to be specifically identified,
and none of them of the same
species as in England, must be represented
by our American pennyroyal
(<i>Hedeoma pulegioides</i>), a native mint
(<i>Mentha borealis</i>), wild basil (<i>Pycnanthemum</i>),
and a species of <i>Monarda</i>,
sometimes called balm, all sweet herbs
of the New England coast. Alexander
is hardly to be guessed. Angelica as a
genus occurs here, but not the officinal
species. Wild sarsaparilla (<i>Aralia nudicaulis</i>)
was probably in view. Purslane
is interesting in this connection,
adding as it does to the probability that
this plant was in the country before the
settlement. There are no Anniseeds in
New England, and it is impossible to
guess what the author meant. It was
probably a random statement founded
on nothing in particular. The Honeysuckles
were doubtless the two species
of <i>Azalea</i> to which the name is still
applied.” Wood also says (<i>Prospect</i>, pp.
11, 12), “There is likewise growing all
manner of Hearbes for meate and medicine,
and not only in planted Gardens,
but in the woods, without either the art or
helpe of man, as sweete Marjoram, Purselane,
Sorrell, Peneriall, Yarrow, Myrtle,
Saxifarilla, Bayes, &amp;c.” See also Mr.
Tuckerman’s introductory matter and
notes, in his edition of <i>New England’s
Rarities</i> [1865], and Professor Gray’s
chapter (vol. i. ch. ii.) on the Flora of
Boston and vicinity, and the changes it
has undergone, in the <i>Memorial History
of Boston</i>.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_312_312" id="Footnote_312_312"></a><a href="#FNanchor_312_312"><span class="label">[312]</span></a> Probably the Whistling Swan (<i>Cygnus
Americanus</i>), now a rare visitor to
New England. Wood, also, in his poetical
enumeration of birds and fowls
(<i>Prospect</i>, p. 23), speaks of

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
     <div class="verse">“The Silver Swan that tunes her mournfull breath,</div>
     <div class="verse">To sing the dirge of her approaching death.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>
Further on (p. 26) he says, “There be
likewise many Swannes which frequent
the fresh ponds and rivers, seldome consorting
themselves with Duckes and
Geese; these be very good meate, the
price of one is six shillings.” In his
enumeration of birds of New England,
Josselyn (<i>Two Voyages</i>, p. 100) mentions
“<i>Hookers</i> or wild-<i>Swans</i>.” This
bird is not included in Peabody’s <i>Report
on the Ornithol. of Massachusetts</i> (1839).</p></div>

still abundant. The identity of the other
two is doubtful: the Pide Duck may
have been the Pied or Labrador Duck
(<i>Camptolæmus Labradorius</i>), a species

wholly extinct; the Gray Duck is probably
the Pintail (<i>Dafila acuta</i>).</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_319_319" id="Footnote_319_319"></a><a href="#FNanchor_319_319"><span class="label">[319]</span></a> Probably some species of web-footed
bird, but exactly what is not clear. Mr.
Merriam, in his <i>Review of the Birds of
Connecticut</i> (pp. 104-5), identifies Morton’s
Simpe as the American Woodcock
(<i>Philohela minor</i>), but in this he
is doubtless in error. In the first place,
it is not likely that a keen sportsman
like Morton would have shot woodcock
merely out of curiosity, and “more did
not regard them;” in the second place,
Josselyn, in enumerating the different
sorts of ducks, speaks of “<i>Widgeons</i>,
<i>Simps</i>, <i>Teal</i>, Blew wing’d and green
wing’d.” (<i>Two Voyages</i>, p. 101.) But
for the reference in the next paragraph
in the text, and the disparaging manner
in which the bird in question is alluded
to, it would be inferred that Simpes was
a natural misprint for Snipes. That,
however, is clearly not the case.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_320_320" id="Footnote_320_320"></a><a href="#FNanchor_320_320"><span class="label">[320]</span></a> The Sanderling (<i>Calidris arenaria</i>),
a common Sandpiper, peculiar in lacking
the usual hind toe. The context indicates
that other shore birds were included
under this name. “There are little Birds
that frequent the Sea-shore in flocks
called <i>Sanderlins</i>, they are about the
bigness of a <i>Sparrow</i>, and in the fall of
the leaf will be all fat; when I was first
in the Countrie the <i>English</i> cut them
into small pieces to put into their Puddings
instead of suet. I have known
twelve score and above kill’d at two
shots.” (Josselyn’s <i>Two Voyages</i>, p. 102.)
To precisely the same effect Wood says
(<i>Prospect</i>, p. 27), “I myselfe have killed
twelve score at two shootes.”</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_321_321" id="Footnote_321_321"></a><a href="#FNanchor_321_321"><span class="label">[321]</span></a> Neither the Whooping Crane (<i>Grus
Americana</i>) nor the Sandhill Crane (<i>Grus
pratensis</i>) is now found in New England.
The latter is probably the species
referred to here. Our large Heron
(<i>Ardea herodias</i>) is often called Crane
by country people, but it does not eat
corn, and “in a dishe” would hardly be
considered “a goodly bird.”</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_322_322" id="Footnote_322_322"></a><a href="#FNanchor_322_322"><span class="label">[322]</span></a> The Wild Turkey (<i>Meleagris gallipavo
Americana</i>) is mentioned by all the
early writers as an abundant bird; but
it disappeared almost as rapidly as the
Indians, before the encroachment of the
white settlers. Peabody, writing in 1839
(<i>Report on the Fishes, Reptiles, and
Birds of Massachusetts</i>, p. 352), says:
“It is still found occasionally in our
western mountains, and also on the Holyoke
range, where some are taken every
year.” Its total extinction probably
occurred only a few years later.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_323_323" id="Footnote_323_323"></a><a href="#FNanchor_323_323"><span class="label">[323]</span></a> Probably an exaggeration, although
Audubon mentions one that weighed
thirty-six pounds; the ordinary weight
of the full-grown male is from fifteen to
twenty pounds, a gobbler weighing twenty-five
pounds being an unusually large
bird. Yet Morton’s statement is fully
borne out by other contemporary authorities.
Wood says, “The Turky is a very
large bird, of a blacke colour, yet white
in flesh; much bigger then our English
Turky. He hath the use of his long legs
so ready, that he can runne as fast as a
Dogge, and flye as well as a Goose: of
these sometimes there will be forty, three-score
and an hundred of a flocke, sometimes
more and sometimes lesse; their
feeding is Acorns, Hawes, and Berries,
some of them get a haunt to frequent our
<i>English</i> corne: In Winter when the
Snow covers the ground, they resort to
the Sea-shore to looke for Shrimps, and
such small fishes at low tides. Such as
love Turkie hunting must follow it in
Winter after a new falne Snow, when he
may follow them by their tracts; some
have killed ten or a dozen in halfe a
day; if they can be found towards an
evening, and watched where they peirch,
if one came about ten or eleaven of the
clocke, he may shoote as often as he
will, they will sit, unlesse they be slenderly
wounded. These Turkies remain
all the yeare long. The price of a good
Turkie cocke is foure shillings: and he
is well worth it, for he may be in weight
forty pound; a Hen two shillings.”
(<i>New England’s Prospect</i>, p. 24.) So
also Josselyn: “I have heard several credible
persons affirm, they have seen <i>Turkie
Cocks</i> that have weighed forty, yea
sixty pounds; but out of my personal
experimental knowledge I can assure
you, that I have eaten my share of a
<i>Turkie Cock</i>, that when he was pull’d
and garbidg’d, weighed thirty pound.”
He adds, however, that even then [1670]
“the <i>English</i> and the <i>Indians</i> having
now destroyed the breed, so that ’tis very
rare to meet with a wild <i>Turkie</i> in the
Woods.” (<i>New England’s Rarities</i>,
p. 9.) See also <i>Two Voyages</i>, p. 99,
where the same writer says: “If you
would preserve the young Chickens alive,
you must give them no water, for if they
come to have their fill of water, they
will drop away strangely, and you will
never be able to rear any of them.” John
Clayton, in his <i>Letter to the Royal Society</i>
[1688], says of Virginia: “There
be wild Turkies extream large; they
talk of Turkies that have been kill’d,
that have weigh’d betwixt 50 and 60
Pound weight; the largest that ever I
saw, weigh’d something better than 38
Pound.” (<span class="smcap lowercase">III.</span> <i>Force’s Tracts</i>, No. 12,
p. 30.) Williams, in his <i>Virginia</i> [1650],
speaks of “infinites of wilde Turkeyes,
which have been knowne to weigh fifty
pound weight, ordinarily forty.” (<span class="smcap lowercase">III.</span>
<i>Force’s Tracts</i>, No. 11, p. 12.) See also
Strachey’s <i>Historie</i>, p. 125; Young’s

Trumbull writes: “<i>Metawna</i> is <i>mittànnug</i>

but to the Indians less definite, ‘a great

<i>Neent</i> is possibly a misprint for <i>necut</i>
(<i>nequt</i>, Eliot), ‘one,’&mdash;but, more likely,
stands for ‘I have,’ or its equivalent,
‘there is to me.’ Roger Williams
(p. 164) puts the numeral first, <i>nneesnneánna</i>,
‘I have killed two,’&mdash;<i>shwinneánna</i>,
[‘I have killed] three,’” &amp;c.</p></div>

early writers has been supposed by ornithologists
to be the Prairie Hen or
Pinnated Grouse (<i>Cupidonia cupido</i>), a
species which, however, has dark not
“white flesh,”&mdash;“formerly ... so common
on the ancient busky site of the city
of Boston, that laboring people or servants
stipulated with their employers,
not to have the <i>Heath-Hen</i> brought to
table oftener then a few times in the
week.” (Nuttall’s <i>Ornithology</i>, vol. i.
p. 800.) There is good evidence that
this bird once ranged over a large part
of Southern New England; it is still
found on Martha’s Vineyard, where it
is carefully protected and is not uncommon.
Elsewhere it does not now occur
much to the eastward of Illinois.</p></div>

(<i>Trochilus colubris</i>), our only New England
species. The Humming-birds are
peculiar to the New World; hence the
wonder and interest with which they
were regarded by the early explorers
and colonists. There is a letter from
Emanuel Downing to John Winthrop,
Jr., of the 21st of November, 1632, in
which is this paragraph: “You have a
litle bird in your contrie that makes
a humminge noyse, a little bigger then a
bee, I pray send me one of them over,
perfect in his fethers, in a little box.”
(<span class="smcap lowercase">IV.</span> <i>Mass. Hist. Coll.</i>, vol. vi. p. 40<sup>e</sup>.)
There are many descriptions of this bird
in the earlier writers, though none that
I have found so early as Downing’s letter.
Wood says: “The Humbird is one
of the wonders of the Countrey, being no
bigger than a Hornet, yet hath all the dimensions
of a Bird, as bill and wings, with
quils, Spider-like legges, small clawes:
For colour, shee is glorious as the Raine-bow;
as shee flies, shee makes a little
humming noise like a humble bee:
wherefore she is called the Humbird.”
(<i>New England’s Prospect</i>, p. 24.) Josselyn’s
description is especially good:
“The <i>Humming Bird</i>, the least of all
Birds, little bigger than a <i>Dor</i>, of variable
glittering Colours, they feed upon
Honey, which they suck out of Blossoms
and Flowers with their long Needle-like
Bills; they sleep all Winter, and are not
to be seen till the Spring, at which time
they breed in little Nests, made up like a
bottom of soft, Silk-like matter, their
Eggs no bigger than a white Pease, they
hatch three or four at a time, and are
proper to this Country.” (<i>New England’s
Rarities</i>, p. 6.) See also Clayton’s
<i>Letter</i>, &amp;c. (<span class="smcap lowercase">III.</span> <i>Force’s Tracts</i>,

notes to this chapter I am indebted to
Mr. Joel A. Allen, of the Museum of
Comparative Zoölogy of Harvard College.
To the matter contributed by
him I have merely added, as in the immediately
preceding chapters, extracts
from other writers, more or less contemporaneous
with Morton, which seemed
to me to be illustrative of the text, or in
the same spirit with it. This chapter of
Morton’s is more complete, though probably
of less value, than Wood’s and Josselyn’s
chapters on the same subject.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_345_345" id="Footnote_345_345"></a><a href="#FNanchor_345_345"><span class="label">[345]</span></a> The <i>Elke</i> here mentioned is the
Moose (<i>Alces malchis</i>) of American
writers; it is specifically the same as the
elk of Northern Europe. From Wood’s
account (<i>New England’s Prospect</i>,
p. 18), it would seem that the moose in
Morton’s time ranged into eastern Massachusetts,
though not found now south
of northern Maine. The moose has
but a single fawn at a birth, not three
as stated in the text.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Allen then adds to the above note:
“I have met with no published record
of the occurrence of the American Elk,
or Wapiti Deer (<i>Cervus Canadensis</i>), in
eastern Massachusetts. Since publishing
a statement to this effect (<i>Mem.
Hist. Boston</i>, vol. i. p. 10), however, I
have learned through the kindness of a
correspondent (Henry S. Nourse, Esq.,
of South Lancaster, Mass.,) that early in
the eighteenth century sixteen elk were
seen near a brook in South Lancaster,
one of which was killed. The tradition
is supported by the fact that the antlers
of the individual killed were preserved
in the family of the lucky hunter (Jonas
Fairbanks) for a long period, and afterwards
placed on the top of a guide-board,
where they still remain, moss-grown
and weather-worn by eighty years
of sun and storm. Since the receipt of
Mr. Nourse’s letter (dated Feb. 25,
1882), his account has been corroborated
by information from another source.
That the antlers mentioned belonged to
an elk and not to a moose is beyond
question.”</p></div>

Plymouth, was caught in one of these
traps, and “horsed up by the leg,”
when the first party from the <i>Mayflower</i>
was exploring Cape Cod in November,
1620. Wood says: “An <i>English</i> Mare
being strayed from her owner, and
growne wild by her long sojourning in
the woods ranging up and down with
the wild crew, stumbled into one of these
traps which stopt her speed, hanging
her like <i>Mahomet’s</i> tombe, betwixt earth
and heaven; the morning being come
the <i>Indians</i> went to looke what good successe
their Venison trapps had brought
them, but seeing such a long scutted
Deere, praunce in their Meritotter, they
bade her good morrow, crying out,
what cheere what cheere, <i>Englishmans

than to call her a woman horse, but
being loath to kill her, and as fearefull
to approach neere the friscadoes of her
Iron heeles, they posted to the <i>English</i>
to tell them how the case stood or hung
with their squaw horse, who unhorsed
their Mare, and brought her to her former
tamenesse, which since hath brought
many a good foale, and performed much
good service.” (<i>New England’s Prospect</i>,
p. 75.) Williams, in his <i>Key</i>
(ch. xxvii.), describes how the deer
caught in these traps were torn and
devoured by wolves before the Indians
came to secure them. See, also, Colonel

The <i>Gray Fox</i> is doubtless the
Virginian or Gray Fox (<i>Urocyon cinereoargentatus</i>)
of the South and West, an
animal formerly occurring in New England
but long since nearly extirpated.
This is inferred from Josselyn’s account
of the <i>Jaccal</i> (<i>New England’s Rarities</i>,
p. 22), rather than from any clew
given in Morton’s text. The absence
of strong scent referred to relates to the
Gray Fox, a character mentioned by
Josselyn in his brief but sufficiently explicit

foxes, which they have often seen, but
never could take any of them. They
say they are Manittóoes, that is Gods,
spirits, or divine powers, as they say of
every thing which they cannot comprehend.”
(Williams’s <i>Key</i>, ch. xvii.) The
black fox-skin, Josselyn says (<i>Rarities</i>,
p. 21), “heretofore was wont to be valued
at fifty and sixty pound, but now
you may have them for twenty shillings;
indeed there is not any in <i>New England</i>
that are perfectly black, but silver
hair’d, that is sprinkled with gray hairs.”
The black wolf’s skin, he says (<i>ib.</i> p. 16),
“is worth a <i>Beaver</i> Skin among the <i>Indians</i>,
being highly esteemed for helping
old Aches in old people, worn as a Coat.”
Of the foxes Wood remarks: “Some of
these be blacke; their furre is of much
esteeme.” (<i>Prospect</i>, p. 19.) Elsewhere
he says that the fur of a black wolf was
“worth five or sixe pounds Sterling.”

being big boned, lanke paunched, deepe

He says: “They commonly go in routs,
a rout of Wolves is 12 or more, sometimes
by couples.” Of the Virginia species,
Clayton says: “Wolves there are
great store; you may hear a Company
Hunting in an Evening, and yelping like
a pack of Beagles; but they are very
cowardly, and dare scarce venture on
anything that faces them; yet if hungry
will pull down a good large Sheep
that flies from them. I never heard
that any of them adventured to set on
Man or Child.” (<span class="smcap lowercase">III.</span> <i>Force’s Tracts</i>, No.
12, p. 37.) According to Strachey, these
Virginia wolves were “not much bigger
then English foxes.” (<i>Historie</i>, p. 125.)
Wood, however, says that the Massachusetts
wolves cared “no more for an ordinary
Mastiffe, than an ordinary Mastiffe
cares for a Curre; many good dogges
have been spoyled by them.” Shortly
after the landing from the <i>Mayflower</i> at
Plymouth, John Goodman, one evening
in January, “went abroad to use his
lame feet, that were pitifully ill with the
cold he had got, having a little spaniel
with him. A little way from the plantation
two great wolves ran after the dog;
the dog ran to him and betwixt his legs
for succour. He had nothing in his
hand, but took up a stick and threw at
one of them and hit him, and they presently
ran both away, but came again.
He got a pale-board in his hand; and
they set both on their tails grinning at
him a good while; and went their way
and left him.” (Young’s <i>Chron. of
Pilg.</i>, p. 178.)</p></div>

Clayton says that “their flesh is commended
for a very rich sort of Pork.”

the Rattlesnake (<i>Crotalus durissus</i>)
were of the most exaggerated kind. He
was described as a reptile of prodigious
size, which could fly, and which poisoned
by its breath. (<i>New England’s Prospect</i>,
p. 39.) The first mention of this
snake in Massachusetts is found in Higginson’s
<i>New England’s Plantation</i>
[1630]. It is as follows: “This country
being very full of woods and wildernesses,
doth also much abound with
snakes and serpents, of strange colors
and huge greatness. Yea, there are
some serpents, called rattlesnakes, that
have rattles in their tails, that will not
fly from a man as others will, but will
fly upon him and sting him so mortally
that he will die within a quarter of
an hour after, except the party stinged
have about him some of the root of an
herb called snake-weed to bite on, and
then he shall receive no harm.” (Young’s
<i>Chron. of Mass.</i>, p. 255.) Wood gives
an admirable description of the rattlesnake
(<i>Prospect</i>, pp. 38-9), and also
speaks of “the Antidote to expel the
poyson, which is a root caled Snake
weede, which must be champed, the
spittle swallowed, and the roote applied
to the sore.... Five or six men have
been bitten by them, which by using of
snakeweede were all cured, never any
yet losing his life by them.” Josselyn, in
his <i>Rarities</i> (p. 39), says: “The <i>Indians</i>
when weary with travelling, will take
them up with their bare hands, laying
hold with one hand behind their Head,
with the other taking hold of their Tail,
and with their teeth tear off the Skin of
their backs, and feed upon them alive;
which they say refresheth them.” He
further says that the heart of the rattlesnake
“swallowed fresh” (<i>Rarities</i>, p.
39), or “dried and pulverized and drunk
with wine or beer” (<i>Voyages</i>, p. 114), is
an antidote against its poison. In Clayton’s
<i>Virginia</i> (<span class="smcap lowercase">III.</span> <i>Force’s Tracts</i>, No. 12,
p. 39), there is a very entertaining passage,
too long to extract, on Rattlesnakes,
and the use of East India snake-stones
“that were sent [to Virginia] by King
<i>James</i> the Second, the Queen, and some
of the Nobility, purposely to try their
Virtue and Efficacy,” at curing the bite
of vipers, &amp;c.</p></div>

Meadow Mouse (<i>Arvicola riparius</i>),
the White-footed Mouse, or Deer

Long-tailed Jumping Mouse, or Kangaroo
Mouse (<i>Zapus Hudsonius</i>). The
common House Mouse (<i>Mus musculus</i>)
is an exotic pest, which doubtless had
not at that time made its appearance.
Morton is quite right in stating: “but
for Rats, the Country by Nature is
troubled with none.” The Black Rat
(<i>Mus rattus</i>) was quite early introduced,

sportsman who had himself been in the
tropics, was wiser on the subject of Lions
than other Englishmen in New England.
From the first landing at Plymouth,
when John Goodman and Peter Browne,
getting lost in the woods, heard “two
lions roaring exceedingly,” down to
1639, when Josselyn heard “of a young
Lyon (not long before) kill’d at Pascataway
by an Indian,” there were vague
stories of these animals having been
either seen or heard in the New England
woods. Josselyn argued on the great
probability that there were lions because
there were jackals (<i>Rarities</i>, p. 21);
and Wood said that “the Virginians saw
an old Lyon in their Plantation, who
having lost his Iackall, which was wont
to hunt his prey, was brought so poore
that he could goe no further.” (<i>Prospect</i>,
p. 17.) Strachey speaks of having
found the skins and claws of lions in
the hands of the Indians. (<i>Historie</i>, p.
124.) The animal referred to in all these
cases was doubtless the Panther or Catamount
(<i>Felis concolor</i>). On this subject
see also Young’s <i>Chron. of Pilg.</i>,
p. 176, <i>note</i>; Tuckerman’s <i>New England’s

<p><a name="Footnote_387_387" id="Footnote_387_387"></a><a href="#FNanchor_387_387"><span class="label">[387]</span></a> This passage is more than usually
confused, even for Morton. It is difficult
to say whether he is perpetrating a clumsy
joke, or indulging in a malicious insinuation.
John Billington was hanged at
Plymouth in September, 1630, being apparently
the second person so executed in
what is now Massachusetts, the first having
been executed at Weymouth during
the winter of 1622-3. (<i>Infra</i>, <a href="#OPage_108">*108-10</a>.)
The man shot by Billington, and for
whose murder he was hung, was John
New-comin (Bradford, p. 277), whence
Morton’s play upon the name. Billington
had two sons, but he was by no
means “beloved.” As Bradford, writing
about him as early as 1625, said, “he is a
knave,” adding prophetically “and so
will live and die.” (Savage’s <i>Winthrop</i>,
vol. i. p. *36). Why Morton should have
called him “Ould Woodman” is not
clear. From his immediately going on
to talk of the “woodden prospect,” and
the wish of its author to secure for himself
a monopoly of the Richmond Island
whetstones, which “Ould Woodman labored
to get a patent of,” it would seem
as if he had intended to convey the idea
that William Wood, the author of the
<i>New England’s Prospect</i>, was one of
the “many sonnes” of “Old Woodman,”
who had been hanged at Plymouth.
That such was Morton’s intention,
however, is not clear. The passage is
muddled, but not necessarily malicious.</p></div>

the fact that Morton saw that whetstones
could be made the basis for trade.
Stones suitable for this purpose are rare
in Europe, and to-day a New Hampshire
company ships large quantities to Europe
and even to Australia.”</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_391_391" id="Footnote_391_391"></a><a href="#FNanchor_391_391"><span class="label">[391]</span></a> Richmond Island lies directly south-east
of Cape Elizabeth and close to
it. From what Morton says in the next
chapter and elsewhere (<i>infra</i>, <a href="#OPage_149">*149</a>), it
would seem that before his arrest by
Standish in June, 1628,&mdash;that is, in the
summer of 1627,&mdash;he had a fur station on
the coast of Maine. (<i>Supra</i>, <a href="#Page_23">23</a>.) Winthrop,
writing under date of October 22,
1631, mentions the murder of “Walter
Bagnall, called Great Watt, and one
John P&mdash;&mdash; who kept with him,” by the
Indians at Richmond Island. He adds:
“This Bagnall was sometimes servant
to one in the bay, and these three years
had dwelt alone in the said isle, and had
gotten about £400 most in goods. He
was a wicked fellow, and had much
wronged the Indians.” (Winthrop, vol.
i. p. *63). Bagnall would, from this, appear
to have been one of Morton’s servants
at Mount Wollaston, as he alone
in “the bay,” at that time, had any
number of servants, or was engaged in
trade on the Maine coast. As Bagnall
was killed in 1631, and had then lived
alone at Richmond Island three years,
he seems to have taken up his abode
there in 1628, the time of the breaking
up of the company at Mount Wollaston
by Standish and Endicott, and the settlement
at Richmond Island was thus the
Maine offshoot of that at Merry-mount.
Bagnall was probably that one of Morton’s
servants who, he says, was reputed,
when he died, to have made a thousand
pounds in the fur trade in five years,
“whatsoever became of it.” (<i>Supra</i>, <a href="#OPage_78">*78</a>).
Morton’s expression here of “five years”
agrees with Winthrop’s “three years,”
and confirms this surmise. Bagnall had
died in 1631. Morton had gotten control
at Mount Wollaston in 1626. (<i>Supra</i>,
<a href="#Page_15">15</a>.) Bagnall had remained there as his
servant two years, until 1628; then had
been frightened away and gone to Richmond
Island, where he had lived three
years more, as Winthrop says,&mdash;making
in all Morton’s five years. In his
phrase “whatsoever became of it” Morton
characteristically throws out an insinuation
in regard to Bagnall’s possessions.
He probably meant to imply
some underhand proceeding to get hold
of them on the part of the Massachusetts
Bay people. Recently a theory has
been advanced in the Maine press, that
Bagnall was an Episcopalian, and competitor
in trade of the Massachusetts
Company; and that Winthrop and his
associates, not being able otherwise to
get rid of him, compassed his death by
indirect means. (See a letter of S. P.
Mayberry in <i>Portland Press</i> of Jan. 9,
1883.) Winthrop says that most of the
possessions in question were in goods.
A portion would naturally be in the form
of money, and it was left for the present
generation to form a most plausible surmise
as to “whatsoever became” of
some of this money. On May 11, 1855,
an old stone pot was turned up by the
ploughshare, on Richmond Island, containing
fifty-two coins; and Mr. Willis,
the historian of Portland, then took
occasion, in a letter to the Massachusetts
Historical Society (<i>Proceedings</i>, May
1857, pp. 183-8), to “express the belief
that the money [was] connected with the
fate of Walter Bagnall, who was killed
by Sagamore Squidraket and his party,
Oct. 3, 1631.” There was nothing to
show that any of the coins were of a
later date than 1631. A patent for
Richmond Island, together with fifteen
hundred acres on the main land, was
issued to Bagnall by the Council for
New England, Dec. 2, 1631, just three
months after his death. (<i>Records of
the Council</i>, pp. 51-2.) Morton was
then in England, and unquestionably in
communication with Gorges. (<i>Supra</i>,

Professor Shaler adds to his foregoing

I get from the writer is that he was a
bad observer, but not more untruthful
than most of the seventeenth century
travellers. He does not say that gold
or silver had been seen by him, and
limits his hearsay evidence to a single
mine. Except for the extraordinary
stuff about the whetstones,&mdash;wherein
we may perhaps see something of the

rather sober and reasonable story.”</p></div>

Mr. Tuckerman remarked that he had

during the autumn and winter. While
with us they are exclusively maritime,
frequenting by choice the vicinity of
outlying ledges and small, rocky islands.
When passing from place to place, they

arranged in long lines or single

my doubts about Morton’s Weenasemute,
but am inclined to believe that his
interpretation is founded on fact. <i>Ashim</i>
(= <i>asim</i>, in local dialect) is once
used by Eliot (<i>Cant.</i> iv. 12) for ‘fountain.’
It denotes a place from which water (for
drinking) is taken. <i>Winn’ashim</i>, or
<i>Winn’asim</i>, means ‘the good fountain,’
or spring; and <i>Winn’asim-ut</i> (or <i>et</i>) is
‘at the good spring.’ The efficacy of
the water ‘to cure barrenness’ may have
been Morton’s embellishment, but not
improbably was an Indian belief.”</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_428_428" id="Footnote_428_428"></a><a href="#FNanchor_428_428"><span class="label">[428]</span></a> This is a gross exaggeration. Thomas
Wiggin, in November, 1622, wrote:
“For the plantation in Mattachusetts,
the English there being about 2000 people,
yonge and old.” (<span class="smcap lowercase">III.</span> <i>Mass. Hist.
Coll.</i>, vol. viii. p. 322.) Writing on May
22, 1634, about the time Morton referred
to (<i>Supra</i>, <a href="#Page_78">78</a>), Governor Winthrop
says: “For the number of our people,
we never took any surveigh of them,
nor doe we intend it, except inforced
throughe urgent occasion (David’s example
stickes somewhat with us) but I
esteeme them to be in all about 4000:
soules and upwarde.” (<i>Proc. Mass.
Hist. Soc.</i>, Dec. 14, 1882.) So in the
<i>New England’s Prospect</i> (p. 42), Wood
speaks of the population of Massachusetts
as “foure thousand soules.” In
the spring of 1634 there may have been
five hundred persons in the Plymouth
colony, and as many more in New Hampshire
and Maine, making a total New
England population of five thousand at
the time Morton was writing. When
the <i>New Canaan</i> was published, however,
in 1637, the population undoubtedly
was as large as 12,000.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_430_430" id="Footnote_430_430"></a><a href="#FNanchor_430_430"><span class="label">[430]</span></a> This astounding proposition was in
the early days of the settlement not peculiar
to Morton. Higginson, in his
<i>New Englands Plantation</i>, speaks of
the “extraordinary clear and dry air,
that is of a most healing nature to all
such as are of a cold, melancholy, phlegmatic,
rheumatic temper of body,” and
concludes what he has to say on the
subject with his often-quoted sentiment
that “a sup of New-England’s air is
better than a whole draught of Old
England’s ale.” (Young’s <i>Chron. of
Mass.</i>, pp. 251-2.) Williams, too, says
in his <i>Key</i> (ch. xiii.): “The <i>Nor-West</i>
wind (which occasioneth <i>New-England</i>
cold) comes over the cold
frozen Land, and over many millions
of Loads of Snow: and yet the pure
wholesomnesse of the Aire is wonderfull,
and the warmth of the Sunne, such
in the sharpest weather, that I have
often seen the Natives Children runne
about starke naked in the coldest
dayes.” Again, in the pamphlet entitled
<i>New England’s First Fruits</i>,
printed in London in 1643, it was stated,
in reply to the objection of extreme winter

very rarely, heard to sneeze or cough,
as ordinarily they do in <i>England</i>, which

it would seem, originally ended
with this chapter. The next chapter
was an afterthought of the author, written
before December, 1635, as is evident
from the allusions in it to events then
taking place. (<i>Supra</i>, <a href="#Page_78">78</a>.) Wood’s
<i>Prospect</i> was published in 1634, and the
constant references to it in the first two
books of the <i>New Canaan</i> show that
they were both written subsequent to its
publication, probably during that year.
In the Third Book there are no allusions
to the <i>Prospect</i>, and the reference
to the Third Book in the Second
(<i>Supra</i>, <a href="#OPage_51">*51</a>), to which attention has
already been called, show that it must
have been written before the others,
and probably during the year 1633.
It would seem to have been completed
in May, 1634. There is, however, also
a reference to be found in the Third

it was probably interpolated during a

the Lakes, it was called the Lake of the
Iroquois, as likewise the River Richelieu,
connecting it and the River St.
Lawrence, they called the River of the
Iroquois. Champlain discovered the
lake in 1609, and gave it his own name.
(<i>Voyages</i>, Prince Soc. ed., vol. ii. pp.
210-20; Parkman’s <i>Pioneers of France</i>,
p. 316.) On some of the early maps it
is put down ‘Lake Champlain or Irocoise.’
It is so called in Purchas’s
<i>Pilgrims</i> (vol. iv. p. 1643). The region
about the lake was sometimes called
Irocosia. The Iroquois lived on the
south of the lake, and, as their enemies
on the north approached them through
this lake, they naturally called it the
Lake of the Iroquois.” (<i>MS. letter of

the history of Canadian settlement in
1621, and remained so for a number of
years. They did not, however, plant
a colony of French in America, nor was
the name of Canada, or of its famous
river, derived from their name. On
this point see Parkman’s <i>Pioneers of
France</i>, pp. 184, <i>note</i>, and 391-5. Morton’s
derivation of the name Canada is
entitled to much the same weight as his
derivation of the names Pantucket and
Mattapan. (<i>Supra</i>, <a href="#Page_124">124</a>.) It was not,
however, peculiar to him as, forty years

under the influence of Buckingham,
Sir William Alexander had been instrumental
in organizing an expedition to
seize the French possessions in America.
At its head were three Huguenots of
Dieppe,&mdash;David, Louis and Thomas
Kirk, brothers. The expedition was
successful, and on the 20th of July, 1629,
Champlain surrendered Quebec to Louis
Kirk. Daniel Kirk, the admiral of
the expedition, returned to England in
November of the same year; but his
brother Thomas remained in Canada
and held Quebec as an English conquest
until July, 1632, when, in accordance
with the conditions of the peace of April
14, 1629, it was restored to France.

was here writing at random. He confounds
the Potomac with the Hudson,
though, a few paragraphs further on
(<i>Infra</i>, <a href="#OPage_99">*99</a>), he states the facts in regard
to the latter river correctly; and the
latitude he gives has no significance, being
that of Poughkeepsie, on the Hudson,
and Cleveland, on Lake Erie. The Potomac
nowhere flows so far north as 40°.
The falls referred to are probably
those of Niagara. They had not then
been discovered (Parkman’s <i>Jesuits
in North America</i>, p. 142), though
vague reports concerning them had
reached the French through the Indians,
and they are plainly indicated on Champlain’s
map of 1629. (<i>Voyages</i>, Prince
Soc. ed., vol. i. p. 271, <i>note</i>.) Some
loose stories in regard to the rivers, falls,
lakes and islands of the interior had
been picked up by Morton, probably in
his talks with seamen and others who
had taken part in Kirk’s expedition.
He certainly fell in with these in London,
and it is more than likely that
at the house of Gorges he saw Champlain’s
map of 1629; though upon that
the falls are placed at 43&frac12; degrees of
latitude, instead of at 41&frac12;. In 1634 there
was no other map. On the strength of
the information thus gathered, he made
the statements contained in this chapter.
The little he knew had been
obtained in England, after his return
there in 1631; for the Massachusetts Indians
can hardly have known much of
the remote interior, and in 1630 no attempts
even at exploration away from
the seashore had been made by the straggling
occupants of the New England
coast.</p></div>

Hampshire and the Laconia enterprise,
it is not necessary to speak at length in
this connection. Mason was the most
prominent character in the early history
of New Hampshire, and the loss which
his death, in December 1635, entailed
on the projects of Gorges and Morton
has already been referred to (<i>Supra</i>, <a href="#Page_76">76</a>).
The late Charles W. Tuttle, of Boston
was at the time of his death engaged in
preparing a life of Mason, which would
unquestionably have been a valuable
addition to the history of the settlement
of New England. The material he had
collected is now in the possession of his
family. In regard to the Laconia Company

of supplies, and heard nothing but complaints
from the Indians of Weston’s people,
who had then been several months

that these latter stripped the grave
at Passonagessit. In any event there can
be little doubt that Morton himself had

<p>
That a man was hung at Wessagusset,
in March 1623, for stealing corn from
the Indians, there can be no doubt.
There is equally little doubt that it was
the real thief who was hung. (Pratt’s
<i>Relation</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">IV.</span> <i>Mass. Hist. Coll.</i>, vol. iv.
p. 491; Young’s <i>Chron. of Pilg.</i>, p. 332;
Bradford, p. 130.) I have already (<i>Supra</i>,
<a href="#Page_96">96</a>) given my own theory as to how
the incident came to take the shape it
did in Butler’s poem. He wrote, I
think, from a vague recollection of an
amusing traveller’s-story, which he had
heard told somewhere years before.
There is no reason to suppose that he
had ever seen the <i>New Canaan</i>.
</p>
<p>
It has always been assumed that Butler’s
version of the affair,&mdash;the vicarious
execution version,&mdash;coming out as
it did in 1664, at a period of violent
reaction against Puritanism, and when
the New England colonies were in extreme
popular disfavor,&mdash;obtained a
foothold in English popular tradition;
much such a foothold, in fact, as the
Connecticut Blue Laws. It was an intangible
something, always at hand to
be cast as a mocking reproach in the
face of a sanctimonious community. As
such it was sure to be resented and disproved;
but never by any disproof could
it be exorcised from the popular mind,
or finally set at rest. This may have
been the case, and the references to the
matter in Hutchinson (vol. i. p. 6, <i>note</i>),
in Hubbard (p. 77), and in Grahame
(Ed. 1845, vol. i. p. 202, <i>note</i>), certainly
look that way. I do not remember, however,
to have myself ever met this particular
charge among the many and singular
charges, much more absurd, which English
writers have from time to time gravely
advanced against America. In Uring’s
<i>Voyages</i> (p. 116-8) there is a singular
account of a similar vicarious execution,
which never could have met the eye of
the author of <i>Hudibras</i>, inasmuch as it
was not published until 1726; but it
shows that either some such event did
take place, or that its having taken
place was at one period a stock traveller’s-tale.</p></div>

whether the story alluded to in
the text belongs to Sommers. He
had been dead eighty years or more
when Morton wrote, and the stories
connected with him had been gotten
together by Armin, and printed in his
<i>Nest of Ninnies</i>, in 1608. This book
Morton had probably seen. In it there
is a story of another famous fool, Jack
Oates, of an earlier period, which is
probably the one Morton had in mind.
Oates is represented as giving an earl,
the guest of his patron, Sir William
Hollis, “a sound box on the ear,” for
saluting Lady Hollis, and then excused
himself on the ground of “knowing not
your eare from your hand, being so like
one another.” (Doran’s <i>Court Fools</i>,
p. 182.) Remembering this story in the
<i>Nest of Ninnies</i>, Morton, with his well-developed
faculty for getting everything
wrong, seems to have fathered it on the
most famous and popular of the occupants
of the <i>Nest</i>.</p></div>

trouble with the English government, in
regard to some ordnance and military
stores, which he had obtained a license
to send to New England, and had then
sold to the French, with whom the English
were at war. (Bradford, p. 150.) He
seems to have been in hiding in consequence
of this transaction; and early in
1623 went on board of one of the fishing-vessels
in the disguise of a blacksmith,
and came out in her to the stations
on the Maine coast. There he
must have learned of the extreme straits,
if not of the abandonment, of his plantation
at Wessagusset, and he set out, with
a companion or two, in an open boat,
for Massachusetts Bay. He was wrecked
near the mouth of the Merrimac, and
barely escaped with his life. The savages
there stripped him to his shirt, and
in this plight he reached Thomson’s
plantation at Piscataqua. Thence he
found his way to Plymouth, arriving
there, not as Morton says, “with supply
and means to have raised [his company’s]
fortunes,” but in absolute destitution.
Bradford’s account of his reception
and of what ensued (pp. 133-4, 149-53)
is very different from that given
in the text; and, it is hardly necessary
to add, reads much more like the truth.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_465_465" id="Footnote_465_465"></a><a href="#FNanchor_465_465"><span class="label">[465]</span></a> The incident here alluded to was
the seizure of the <i>Swan</i>, under a warrant
issued by Captain Robert Gorges,
acting as Lieutenant of the Council for
New England, in November, 1623. The
<i>Swan</i> was a small vessel of 30 tons
measurement, which Weston had sent
out with his expedition, in 1622. His
plan was, when the larger vessel&mdash;the
<i>Charity</i>, in which his company went
out&mdash;returned to England, to have the
<i>Swan</i> remain in New England, to be
used for trading purposes. Accordingly,
all through the winter of 1622-3, it had
been at Wessagusset, except when employed
by the people there in obtaining
supplies in connection with the Plymouth
people. When, in March, 1623,
Wessagusset was abandoned, the company
went in the <i>Swan</i> to the Maine
fishing-stations. Here Weston found the
vessel in the course of the following summer,
and recovered possession of her.
He then began to trade along the coast.
Meanwhile, in September, Captain Robert
Gorges arrived, and immediately set
out to look for Weston, in order to call
him to account for the ordnance transactions
referred to in the preceding note,
and also for the disorderly conduct of his
people at Wessagusset during the previous
winter. Starting for the eastward,
he was driven into Plymouth Harbor by
heavy weather, and while he was lying
there the <i>Swan</i> made its appearance
with Weston on board. Bradford’s account
of what ensued, including the seizure
of the vessel, differs <i>toto cœlo</i> from
that in the text. He says that Captain
Robert Gorges, acting as governor-general
under his commission from the
Council for New England, at once organized
a sort of a court,&mdash;he, Bradford,
acting as an assistant in it,&mdash;and proceeded
to arraign and try Weston. As a result
of the whole proceedings Gorges threatened
to send Weston under arrest back
to England. Through the intercession of
Bradford, however, he was mollified,
and finally Weston was released on his
own promise to appear when called for.
Gorges then went to Wessagusset, leaving
Weston with the <i>Swan</i> at Plymouth.
After a time Gorges seems to have concluded
that it would be very convenient
for him to have control of the <i>Swan</i>, at
any rate for that winter. Accordingly
he sent a warrant to Plymouth for its
seizure and the arrest of Weston. Bradford,
not liking this proceeding, took
some exception to the warrant, and refused
to allow it to be served. At the
same time it was intimated to Weston
that he had better take himself and his
vessel off. This he would not do. Apparently
his crew was mutinous and
unruly, their wages being long in arrears,
and the <i>Swan</i> destitute of supplies.
He seems to have looked upon
arrest and seizure as the best way out of
his difficulties. Presently a new warrant
came from Gorges, and both vessel and
prisoner were removed to Wessagusset.
This was in November. There they
passed the winter of 1623-4. Towards
spring Gorges went in the <i>Swan</i> to the
eastward, Weston accompanying him,
apparently as a pilot. The tidings received
there led the disappointed young
Lieutenant of the Council to decide on
immediately returning to England. Accordingly
he came back to Wessagusset,
and thence went probably to the fishing-stations,
very possibly in the <i>Swan</i>.
Before leaving he effected some sort of
a settlement with Weston,&mdash;Bradford
intimates much to the advantage of the
latter,&mdash;who was released from arrest,
had his vessel restored to him, and was
compensated for whatever loss he had
sustained. Weston thereupon reappeared
at Plymouth, and thence went to Virginia.
He seems to have traded along
the coast for some years, but finally
drifted back to England, where in 1645
he died, at Bristol, of the plague. (Bradford,
pp. 140-53. Young’s <i>Chron. of
Pilg.</i>, pp. 296-8, 302.)</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_466_466" id="Footnote_466_466"></a><a href="#FNanchor_466_466"><span class="label">[466]</span></a> This chapter relates to incidents of
no apparent consequence, and of which
there is no other record. It is not easy
even to fix the time at which they occurred,
and it would seem as if Morton,
in his rambling, incoherent way, had
confused the events of one year with those
of another. The only time when “35
stout knaves” were landed, at all in the
way described, at Plymouth, was in July,
1622, when the <i>Charity</i> brought in there
Weston’s company. Yet Morton speaks
of there then being “three cows” at
Plymouth, which would indicate that
Morton’s arrival, referred to in the text,
was not in July 1622, but at some time
subsequent to the spring of 1624, when
Winslow brought over “three heifers
and a bull, the first beginning of any
cattle of that kind in the land.” (Bradford,
p. 158.) Yet Weston, again, had
no “barque” at Plymouth after 1623.
The chapter seems to have been introduced
simply for the purpose of working
on the church prejudices of Laud against
the Puritans. (See <i>supra</i>, <a href="#Page_93">93-4</a>.) There
is in it a combination of “the booke of
common prayer” and “claret sparklinge
neate,” which is suggestive of the <i>Book
of Sports</i> as well as of “the Word of
God.”</p></div>

(pp. 273-6) relate to the same matter.
It is impossible to venture a surmise
even as to their meaning. It would
seem clear that they have no historical
value, but relate rather to some
humorous incident&mdash;having the full
seventeenth-century flavor of coarseness&mdash;which
occurred in the settlement of
Boston Bay. Apparently, judging by the
expressions, “this goodly creature of incontinency”
(<i>Infra</i>, <a href="#OPage_129">*129</a>), “that had
tried a camp royal in other parts” (<a href="#OPage_121">*121</a>),
some English prostitute found her way
out to Mount Wollaston, in company
with one of the adventurers there, and
subsequently went on to Virginia. She
may have come with Wollaston, and
been left in Boston Bay when her companion
went to Virginia, and then followed
him, giving birth to a child on
the way. This would explain the allusion
to Phyllis and Demophoön subsequently
made (p. *129). It is, however,
a mere surmise on a subject not worth
puzzling over.</p></div>

As the settlement of Virginia
dated from 1607, the twenty-seven years
he speaks of was equivalent to saying,
“up to the time at which he was writing,”
viz. 1634. Virginia was then not
only a much older settlement, but it had
a population largely in excess of that of
New England.</p></div>

buffoon, attached to the household of
Edward IV., whose head Justice Shallow
makes the youthful Falstaff break
at the court gate (<i>Henry IV.</i> Part II.
act iii. sc. 2), though Falstaff is represented
as having died at least twenty
years before Scogan could have been
born. In regard to him, see Doran’s
<i>Court Fools</i>, pp. 123-30. “Scogan’s
choice,” in Morton’s day, seems to have
been a popular expression, signifying
that a choice of some sort is better
than no power to choose at all. It was
derived probably from the story of Scogan,
that he was once ordered to be
hanged, but allowed the privilege of
choosing the tree. He escaped the penalty
by being unable to find a tree to
his liking. Morton uses the expression
again, see <i>infra</i>, <a href="#OPage_137">*137</a>. But the reference

in Boston, two years later, with that
at Plymouth in 1628. In 1630 the master
of the <i>Gift</i> refused to carry him back
to England. (<i>Supra</i>, <a href="#Page_44">44</a>.) In the spring
of 1628, however, no vessel seems to have
arrived at Plymouth from England, as
Allerton then brought over an assortment
of goods, and came in a fishing-vessel
by way of the Maine stations.
(Bradford, p. 232.) Allerton returned
to London in the course of the succeeding
summer or autumn, but it is not
probable then any vessel left Plymouth
in June, 1628, bound for England. (<i>Supra</i>,

<p><a name="Footnote_493_493" id="Footnote_493_493"></a><a href="#FNanchor_493_493"><span class="label">[493]</span></a> It was not until towards the close of

returned to Massachusetts in company

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_494_494" id="Footnote_494_494"></a><a href="#FNanchor_494_494"><span class="label">[494]</span></a> Morton implies above that the
“Poem” which follows was written
shortly after the events to which it relates
occurred, and before his return to
New England in 1629. It was then, it
seems, “in use” in London. The name
of Ben Jonson appears in the margin of
the original edition, as of this reprint,
and opposite the first two lines, as above.
Exactly what this signifies it is impossible
now to say. Some critics that I
have consulted are inclined to think
that Jonson, who was then about fifty-five
years old and at the height of his
fame, may have written all the verses.
Others suggest that Morton, by putting
the name in the margin, meant to imply
that Jonson wrote them all, and that
this was another of the unscrupulous
tricks of the author of the <i>New Canaan</i>.
Neither explanation commends itself to
my judgment. The first five verified
lines are a paraphrase of five lines at
the beginning of one of Jonson’s productions,
for a poem it is not. In his
published works (Gifford’s ed. [1816],
vol. viii. p. 241) they appear as follows:&mdash;
</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
     <div class="verse">“I sing the brave adventure of two wights,</div>
     <div class="verse">And pity ’tis, I cannot call them knights:</div>
     <div class="verse">One was; and he for brawn and brain right able</div>
     <div class="verse">To have been styled of king Arthur’s table.</div>
     <div class="verse">The other was a squire, of fair degree.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>
With the last of the foregoing lines the
paraphrase stops, and the rest of the
verses in the <i>New Canaan</i> are, it must
in justice be said, not only more cleanly,
but in other respects superior to those
to be found in Jonson’s works. Indeed,
where the latter are not unintelligible,
they are almost unequalled for the nastiness
in which the writer seems to revel.
Gifford not too strongly remarks of them,
“I dislike the subject.” Morton, it appears
to me, abandoning, at the sixth
line, the paraphrase with which he began,
went on with a production of his own, but
very properly put Jonson’s name opposite
the lines he borrowed from him. The
remainder is in his own style, and not
inferior to the mass of the contemporary
verse. He himself explains it. The
“nine worthy wights” are Standish and
his party, who were sent to arrest him.
The “prodigeous birth,” was the establishment
of the Mount Wollaston plantation.
The “seven heads” were the
seven persons composing the company at
Mount Wollaston at the time of the arrest.
The “forked tail” was the Maypole,
with its antlered top. The fear that
the Hydra of Ma-re Mount would devour
“all their best flocks” refers to the apprehended
competition in the fur trade.
The “Soll in Cancer” indicates the
season; the “thundering Jove” the
storm, in which Morton made his escape
from his captors at Wessagusset. The
arrest at Mount Wollaston is passed over
very lightly. Then follows the discussion
among the magistrates at Plymouth,
as to the disposition to be made of the
prisoner. Standish would seem to be designated
under the name of Minos. He
recommends death. Eacus is more difficult
to identify. In the preceding
chapter (<i>Supra</i>, <a href="#Page_288">288</a>), Morton speaks of
him as being the one whose “voice was
more allowed of then both the others.”
My supposition is that, by Eacus, Morton
meant Dr. Samuel Fuller, who then
apparently (Bradford, pp. 264, <i>note</i>, 306,
<i>note</i>) stood, next to Standish, at the head
of the assistants. Morton says that he
“confounded all the arguments that
Eacus could make;” and he afterwards,
in the <i>New Canaan</i>, refers to Fuller
with peculiar bitterness. (<i>Infra</i>, <a href="#Page_298">298</a>.)
“Sterne Radamant” is clearly Bradford,
“the cheif Elder.” The remainder
of the poem calls for no explanation;
and the whole of it is much less unintelligible
than is usual with Morton.</p></div>

is Dr. Samuel Fuller. There is a notice
of Dr. Fuller in Young’s <i>Chron. of Pilg.</i>
(p. 222, <i>note</i>), and in Eliot’s <i>Biog. Dict.</i>
He was one of those who came over in
the <i>Mayflower</i>; but that he was born in
the County of Somerset, and bred a
butcher, appears only from the statement
in the text. At Plymouth, besides
being the physician of the colony, he
was a magistrate and a deacon of the
church. He died there, of an infectious
fever, in 1633, and his best possible epitaph
is read in Bradford (p. 314): “A
man godly, and forward to do good,
being much missed after his death.”</p></div>

a cousin of Governor Cradock.
Little is known of her. She came to
New England with her husband, and
died during the very early days of
the settlement, as she seems to have
been in failing health in September,
1628. Endicott was married to his
second wife August 18, 1630; on the
17th of the following month he sat among
the magistrates at Boston in judgment
upon the author of the <i>New Canaan</i>,
who had been “sent for” just five days
after the marriage, which seems to have
taken place at Charlestown. (Winthrop,
vol. i. p. *30; Young’s <i>Chron. of Mass.</i>,
pp. 131, 292; <i>Supra</i>, <a href="#Page_43">43-4</a>.)</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_504_504" id="Footnote_504_504"></a><a href="#FNanchor_504_504"><span class="label">[504]</span></a> This was the case of Roger Clerk,
of Wandsworth, attached in the chamber
of the Guildhall of London, before
the mayor and aldermen, on the 13th
of May, 1382, on a plea of deceit and
falsehood as to Roger atte Hacche.
The record is to be found in Riley’s
<i>Memorials of London and London
Life</i> (pp. 464-6), and is very curious as
illustrating English manners in the time
of Richard II. Morton’s reference
would indicate that the case had then
been handed down as a tradition for two
hundred and fifty years. It seems that
Clerk gave Hacche a bit of old parchment,
rolled up in “a piece of cloth of
gold,” asserting that it was very good
for the ailments with which his wife
was afflicted. Upon being arraigned,
Clerk contended that upon the parchment
was written “a good charm for
fevers.” Upon examination, no word
of the alleged charm was found in the
paper. The court then told the prisoner
“that a straw beneath his foot would
be of just as much avail for fevers,
as this charm of his was; whereupon,
he fully granted that it would be so.
And because that the same Roger Clerk
was in no way a literate man, and seeing
that on the examinations aforesaid,
(as well as others afterwards made,)
he was found to be an infidel, and altogether
ignorant of the art of physic or
of surgery; and to the end that the people
might not be deceived and aggrieved
by such ignorant persons etc.; it was
adjudged that the same Roger Clerk
should be led through the middle of the
City, with trumpets and pipes, he riding
on a horse without a saddle, the said
parchment and a whetstone, for his lies,
being hung about his neck, an urinal
also being hung before him, and another
urinal on his back.”
</p>
<p>
The punishment of the “pillory and
the whetstone,” as it was called, was
that ordinarily imposed on those telling
falsehoods. In another case in the same
volume (p. 316) it is thus given in detail:
“The said John shall come out
of Newgate without hood or girdle,
barefoot and unshod, with a whetstone
hung by a chain from his neck, and
lying on his breast, it being marked with
the words,&mdash;‘A false liar;’ and there
shall be a pair of trumpets trumpeting
before him on his way to the pillory.”</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_505_505" id="Footnote_505_505"></a><a href="#FNanchor_505_505"><span class="label">[505]</span></a> The person referred to in this chapter
was probably the Rev. Francis
Bright, of whom very little is known.
He was one of the three ministers sent
over by the Massachusetts Company in
1629, Higginson and Skelton being the
other two. In June of that year, when
Graves and the Spragues were sent by
Endicott to effect a settlement at
Charlestown, Bright accompanied them
as “minister to the Company’s servants.”
(Young’s <i>Chron. of Mass.</i>, pp. 316,
376.) As such, he was the Caiaphas,
or high-priest, of that region, and it
naturally devolved on him to “exercise
his guifts on the Lords day at
Weenasimute.” Morton further says
that the person he refers to had been
a silenced minister in England. That
Bright had been silenced is not known,
but both Skelton and Higginson had
been (<i>Magnalia</i>, B. <span class="smcap lowercase">I.</span> ch. iv. § 4;
Neal’s <i>Hist. of Puritans</i>, vol. ii. p. 229);
and, though Hubbard intimates that
Bright was a conformist (p. 113), yet,
in the Company’s letter to Endicott, the
three ministers are stated to have “declared
themselves to us to be of one
judgment, and to be fully agreed on the
manner how to exercise their ministry.”
(Young’s <i>Chron. of Pilg.</i>, p. 160.) Winthrop,
Morton adds, “spied out Caiphas
practise; and he must be packing.”
Bright returned to England shortly after
Winthrop’s arrival. Johnson says (<i>Wonder-working
Providence</i>, p. 20) that he
“betooke him to the Seas againe,”
when he saw that “all sorts of stones
would not fit in the building.”
</p>
<p>
Samuel Skelton is referred to by
Morton a few pages further on (<i>Infra</i>,
<a href="#Page_306">306</a>) as “Pastor Master Eager,” which
name may be taken to imply “covetousness”
in him. But, though Skelton
might be termed the “Caiphas” of the
country, he was not silenced by Winthrop.
He can, therefore, hardly be the
person here aimed at.</p></div>

and “collector for the company”
at the time Endicott was sent over, but
of him nothing is known. (Young’s

more probable that Increase Nowell
was the person Morton had in mind.
Nowell was one of the original patentees,
contributing money to forward the
purposes of the company, serving on
committees, &amp;c. (<i>Ib.</i> p. 262.) He
came to New England with Winthrop,
and was among the magistrates who
were present at the trial of Morton in
September, 1630. (<i>Records</i>, vol. i.
pp. 73, 75.) He was the first ruling-elder
of the Charlestown church. He
is described as having been “a worthy
pious man” (Eliot); and if he was the
person intended by Morton,&mdash;which is
not at all clear,&mdash;the propriety of calling
him Ananias, if it rests on anything,
is not apparent from the record.</p></div>

Winthrop is supposed to have
brought over the charter of 1629, is still
to be seen in the office of the Secretary
of the Commonwealth at the State
House in Boston; and that in which
Endicott brought over the patent of
1628 was, it may be inferred from the
text, similar in appearance. It very
much resembles the case for “some instrument
of musick,” being a flat, narrow
box, 2 feet 10 inches long, by 3&frac12;
inches wide and 3 inches deep. It has
a species of circular annex, so to speak,
at its middle, intended to contain the seal.
This annex, like the box, is of wood,
and is 7 by 8 inches in surface, and the
same in depth as the main case, of which
it is a part. The whole is covered with
stamped leather, now brown and mouldered
with age. There are, however,
some things about this case which suggest
doubts as to its having been made
quite so early as the time of Charles I.</p></div>

a translation of Epictetus, furnishes
me the following note on this
allusion: “The phrase ‘bear and forbear’
has always been received as the
formula especially characteristic of Epictetus.
It is most explicitly preserved to
us in the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Noctes Atticæ</i> of Aulus Gellius
(B. <span class="smcap lowercase">XVII.</span> ch. xix. §§ 5-6). Gellius says:
‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Verba duo dicebat</span>: <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἀνέχου καὶ ἀπέχου</span>,’
having previously explained their meaning.
There was in 1634 no English
translation of any portion of Epictetus
containing the phrase; nor was he an
author then much read at the English
universities. Morton probably, therefore,
got the quotation from the Latin
of Aulus Gellius; if, indeed, he did not
pick it up in listening to the talk of
some more scholarly man,&mdash;possibly
Ben Jonson.”</p></div>

under which Morton alludes to Philip
Ratcliff. This man was a servant or
agent of Governor Matthew Cradock.
He got into trouble with Endicott and
the members of the Salem church, and,
according to Winthrop, “being convict,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ore tenus</i>, of most foul, scandalous invectives
against our churches and government,
was censured to be whipped,
lose his ears, and be banished the plantation,
which was presently executed.”
(p. *56.) Another authority speaks of
the offence as a “most horible blasphemy.”
(<span class="smcap lowercase">III.</span> <i>Mass. Hist. Coll.</i>, vol. viii.
p. 323.) In the <i>Records of Massachusetts</i>
(p. 88), under date of June 14
(24 <span class="smcap lowercase">N. S.</span>), 1631, the sentence read as
follows: “It is ordered, that Philip
Ratcliffe shall be whipped, have his
ears cut off, fined 40 l., and banished
out of the limits of this jurisdiction, for
uttering malicious and scandalous
speeches against the government and
the church of Salem, &amp;c., as appeareth
by a particular thereof, proved upon
oath.” The severity of this sentence
caused much scandal in England after
Ratcliff returned there, and in April of
the next year Edward Howes wrote out
to John Winthrop, Jr.: “I have heard
diverse complaints against the severitie
of your Government especially Mr. Indicutts,

about cuttinge off the Lunatick mans

at Charlestown were Robert Hale and
Ralph Monsall. The Charlestown church,
however, was not organized until November,
1632, sixteen months after Ratcliff’s
punishment. (Budington’s <i>First
Church of Charlestown</i>, pp. 31, 34.)
</p>
<p>
The Boston church in June, 1631, had
but one deacon, William Aspinwall
(Ellis’s <i>First Church of Boston</i>, p. 328),
in regard to whom there is a detailed
note in Savage’s <i>Winthrop</i> (p. *32). He
was the deacon of the Charlestown
church at the time Morton was arraigned
and punished, and it is possible
that Morton refers to him as Shackles.
Aspinwall was a man of prominence in
the settlement; but it must be remembered
that, thirteen years later, “two of
our ministers’ sons, being students in
the college, robbed two dwelling-houses
in the night of some pounds. Being
found out, they were ordered by the
gouvernours of the college to be there
whipped, which was performed by the
president himself&mdash;yet they were about
20 years of age.” (Winthrop, vol. ii.
p. *166.) If the president of the college
could officiate at the whipping-post in
1644, in a case of what Winthrop calls
“burglary,” there seems no good reason
why the deacon of the church should
not have officiated there in 1631 in a
case which the same authority calls
“foul, scandalous invectives against our
churches.”</p></div>

as a political pamphlet of the time, intended
to effect a given result in a particular
quarter, has already been referred
to. (<i>Supra</i>, pp. <a href="#Page_68">68-9</a>.) In this respect
the present chapter is the most significant
one in the book. It was intended to act
on the well-known prejudices of Archbishop
Laud, the head and controlling
spirit of that Board of Lords Commissioners
of Foreign Plantations which
then had supreme authority over the
colonies. To that Board Morton dedicated
his book; and at the time he was
writing it the Lords Commissioners, and
especially the Archbishop, were taking
active measures to vacate the Massachusetts
charter and to assume the direct
government of the colonies. It is its
connection with these facts which alone
gives any great degree of historical value
to the present chapter. In itself it is
not deserving of careful annotation, as
it contains nothing that is new, and the
ground is much better covered by Lechford
in his <i>Plaine Dealing</i>. Like Morton,
Lechford was a lawyer; and, unlike
Morton, he was by nature a devout
man. A member of the Church of England
he has given in his book a remarkably
vivid and fair-minded description
of the practice of the New England
churches during the earliest days of the
settlement. Mr. Trumbull’s very learned
and elaborate notes to his edition of
the <i>Plaine Dealing</i>, which is the edition
referred to in the notes to the present
chapter, have cleared up Lechford’s text
wherever it is obscure; and they obviate
the necessity of any careful annotation
of the present chapter, except where it
is desirable to call notice to the special
bearing any particular assertion made
may be supposed to have had on Archbishop
Laud’s idiosyncrasies.</p></div>

to the Fleet. (<i>Supra</i>, <a href="#Page_69">69</a>; <i>Proc.

<p><a name="Footnote_539_539" id="Footnote_539_539"></a><a href="#FNanchor_539_539"><span class="label">[539]</span></a> There probably never was any regularly
chosen deaconess in New England.
The office was recognized as
having come down from the primitive
churches (Dexter’s <i>Congregationalism</i>,
p. 69); and Robert Browne in his definitions,
in the <i>Life and Manners of all
true Christians</i>, says: “The <i>widow</i> is a
person having office of God to pray for
the church, and to visit and minister to
those which are afflicted and distressed
in the church; for the which she is tried
and received as meet.” (Bacon’s <i>Genesis
of the New England Churches</i>, p.
84.) Bradford in his <i>Dialogue</i>, written
in 1648, speaking of the Separatist church
at Amsterdam, says, that besides the pastor,
teacher, elders and deacons, there
was “one ancient widow for a deaconess,
who did them service many years,
though she was sixty years of age when
she was chosen. She honored her place
and was an ornament to the congregation.
She usually sat in a convenient
place in the congregation, with a little
birchen rod in her hand, and kept little
children in great awe from disturbing
the congregation. She did frequently
visit the sick and weak, especially women,
and, as there was need, called out
maids and young women to watch and
do them other helps as their necessity
did require; and if they were poor, she
would gather relief for them of those
that were able, or acquaint the deacons;
and she was obeyed as a mother in
Israel and an officer of Christ.” (Young’s
<i>Chron. of Pilg.</i>, p. 455.) It would be
inferred from the passage quoted that
there had in 1648 never been a deaconess
in the Plymouth church, as in this
<i>Dialogue</i> the old men are supposed to
be describing to the young men events
strange to the latter, as having occurred
long before. Lechford says, speaking of
the Massachusetts colony: “No church
there has a Deaconesse, as far as I
know.” (<i>Plaine Dealing</i>, pp. 24, 40)
“I have not met with an instance of
[the] actual institution [of the office of
deaconess] in New England.” (Palfrey,
vol. ii. p. 37, <i>note</i>.)
</p>
<p>
It does not seem, however, to have
been even theoretically one of the functions
of the deaconess “to use her gifts
at home,” as Morton says, “in an assembly
of her sex, by way of repetition,
or exhortation.” This would rather
have pertained to the office of teacher.
Meetings of females, such as those described,
were held in the parishes during
the early days, and played an important
part in the Antinomian controversy.
The deaconess did not, however, officiate
at them. The character of these
meetings appears in the following passage
at the trial of Mrs. Hutchinson:
</p>
<p>
“<span class="smcap">Court.</span> ... What say you to your
weekly public meetings? Can you find
a warrant for them?
</p>
<p>
<span class="smcap">Mrs. Hutchinson.</span> I will show you
how I took it up. There were such
meetings in use before I came; and
because I went to none of them, this
was the special reason of my taking up
this course. We began it with but five
or six, and, though it grew to more in future
time, yet, being tolerated at the first,
I knew not why it might not continue.
</p>
<p>
<span class="smcap">Court.</span> There were private meetings
indeed, and are still in many places,
of some few neighbors; but not so public
and frequent as yours; and are of
use for increase of love and mutual edification.
But yours are of another nature.
If they had been such as yours
they had been evil, and therefore no
good warrant to justify yours. But answer
by what authority or rule you uphold
them?
</p>
<p>
<span class="smcap">Mrs. H.</span> By Titus ii. 3-5, where the
elder women are to teach the younger.
</p>
<p>
<span class="smcap">Court.</span> So we allow you to do, as
the Apostle there means, privately and
upon occasion. But that gives no warrant
of such set meetings for that purpose.
And, besides, you take upon you
to teach many that are older than yourself.
Neither do you teach them that
which the Apostle commands, viz: to
keep at home.
</p>
<p>
<span class="smcap">Mrs. H.</span> Will you please to give me
a rule against it, and I will yield.
</p>
<p>
<span class="smcap">Court.</span> You must have a rule for it,
or else you cannot do it in faith. Yet
you have a plain rule against it,&mdash;‘I
suffer not a woman to teach.’ (I. Tim.
ii. 12.)
</p>
<p>
<span class="smcap">Mrs. H.</span> That is meant of teaching
men.”
</p>
<p>

also the version to the same effect in
Hutchinson’s <i>Massachusetts</i>, vol. ii. pp.
484-7.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_542_542" id="Footnote_542_542"></a><a href="#FNanchor_542_542"><span class="label">[542]</span></a> There was no minister at Plymouth
in the spring of 1628, when Morton was
there. William Brewster was the ruling
elder in the church and officiated in its
pulpit, where, from the beginning, he
had “taught twice every sabbath, and
that both powerfully and profitably, to
the great contentment of the hearers, and
their comfortable edification.” (Young’s
<i>Chron. of Pilg.</i>, p. 467; Bradford, pp.
187-8.) In the summer of 1628, but
after Morton had been sent to England,
Allerton brought over Mr. Rogers as a
preacher, who soon proved to be “crased
in his braine” (Bradford, p. 243), and the
next season was sent home. In the autumn,
apparently, of 1629, and while
Morton may have been at Plymouth at
Allerton’s house (<i>Ib.</i> p. 253), before his
final return to Mount Wollaston, the
Rev. Ralfe Smith, who had come over
with Skelton and Higginson in the previous
June (Young’s <i>Chron. of Mass.</i>,
p. 151), was found at Nantasket and
brought down to Plymouth. (Bradford,
p. 263.) He was not, however, chosen
into the ministry there until a later time.
(<i>Ib.</i>) It is unlikely that Morton here
refers to Plymouth personages. He was
at Salem in 1629 (<i>Supra</i>, <a href="#Page_306">306</a>), and in
Boston, where as a prisoner he was undoubtedly
made regularly to attend divine
service, from early September to
the end of December, 1630. (<i>Supra</i>,
<a href="#Page_45">45</a>; Young’s <i>Chron. of Mass.</i>, p. 321.)
At Salem he had come in contact with
Skelton and Higginson; and it has
been seen (<i>Supra</i>, <a href="#Page_300">300</a>, <i>note</i> 1) that he
probably knew something of Francis
Bright of Charlestown. The only other
ministers then in the colony were John
Warham and John Maverick at Dorchester,
George Phillips at Watertown,
and John Wilson at Boston.</p></div>

that the three following pages are largely
the fruit of Morton’s imaginative powers,
and were intended for the special
edification of Archbishop Laud. As
Plymouth was much less well supplied
with preachers than the towns of the
Massachusetts colony, it is altogether
probable&mdash;as Dr. John Eliot surmised,
in his review of the <i>New Canaan</i>, in the
<i>Monthly Anthology</i> for July, 1810&mdash;the
allusions to the church-practises in
this chapter found their largest basis of
fact in incidents which Morton had been
a witness of in the Plymouth meeting-house.
It is safe to add, however, that
he could have had no agreeable recollections
of the meeting-houses at Boston
and Charlestown.</p></div>

in this place, which, according to
the laudable custome of the Low-Countries,
in which they had lived, was
thought most requisite to be performed
by the magistrate, as being a civill thing,
upon which many questions aboute inheritances
doe depende, with other things
most proper to their cognizans, and most
consonante to the scripturs. Ruth 4.
and no wher found in the gospell to be
layed on the ministers as a part of their
office.” (Bradford, p. 101.) The marriage
here referred to was that of Edward
Winslow to Mrs. Susannah White.
It took place in May, Winslow’s wife
having died seven weeks before, and
Mrs. White’s husband, William, twelve
weeks before. That he had married
people was, it will be remembered, the
other of the two charges advanced
against Winslow himself, at the Privy
Council hearing just referred to. (<i>Supra</i>,
<a href="#Page_322">322</a>, <i>note</i> 2.) The practice of civil marriage
already prevailed in the Massachusetts
colony also, as, a week before the
arrest of Morton was ordered, Governor
Endicott, on August 18, 1630, was married,
at Charlestown apparently, “by the
governour and Mr. Wilson.” (Winthrop,
vol. i. p. *30. See also <i>Plaine Dealing</i>,
pp. 86-7.) There are few more edifying
examples of the casuistical skill of Winthrop
and his associates than is afforded
by his method of dealing with the question
of civil marriages, as explained in
detail in his <i>Journal</i> (vol. i. p. *323).
“In our church discipline, and in matters
of marriage, to make a law that
marriages should not be solemnized by
ministers is repugnant to the laws of
England; but to bring it to a custom by
practice for the magistrates to perform
it, is no law made repugnant, etc.” The
charter of 1629 empowered the General
Court of the colony “to make, ordeine,
and establishe all Manner of wholesome
and reasonable Orders, Lawes, Statutes,
and Ordinances, Directions, and Instructions,
not contrary to the Lawes of
theis our Realme of England.” (Hazard,

of James I. at Hampton Court in January,
1603, one of the practices of the
English Church especially excepted to
as a “relique of popery” by Dr. John
Reynolds, the spokesman of the Puritans,
was the ring in marriage. (Neal’s
<i>Hist. of Puritans</i>, vol. ii. p. 42.) Among
the reasons urged against its use I have
not elsewhere found the “diabolical
circle” argument. It seems rather to
have been associated in the Puritan
mind with the Romish traditions.
(Jones’s <i>Finger-Ring Lore</i>, pp. 288-90.)
This count, in Morton’s indictment,
was based on good grounds. “In the

well laid. The children of the non-communicants
in early New England could
not be baptized; though they might be
if either one of the parents was a member
of the church. At a later period this
became one of the leading causes of political
agitation in the colony, and is referred
to in the Dr. Robert Childs petition
of 1646. In 1670 from four fifths to
five sixths of the adult male inhabitants
of Massachusetts were without the franchise,
as being non-communicants.

by the early reformers in referring
to the Mass. Calvin called it “an
execrable idol;” Hooper, “a wicked
idol.” Bradford&mdash;not Governor William,
but John, the Smithfield martyr of
Queen Mary’s time&mdash;terms it an “abominable
idol of bread;” and again, “the
horriblest and most detestable device
that ever the devil brought out by man.”
Bland, rector of Adishan, repeated the
familiar figure, calling it a “most blasphemous
idol;” and Latimer improved
upon this by adding the words, “full of
idolatry, blasphemy, sacrilege against
God and the dear sacrifice of His Christ.”
(Blunt’s <i>Reformation of the Church of
Eng.</i>, vol. ii. pp. 399-402.) The derivation
of the Book of Common Prayer, in
many of its parts, from the Missal was
unmistakable; and naturally the next
race of religious reformers applied to
the former the same earnest epithets of
theological dissent which had before
been applied to the latter. Accordingly,
in Barrowe’s <i>Brief Discovery of the False
Church</i>, we find the Book of Common
Prayer referred to as “a detestable idol,
... old rotten stuff ... abstracted out
of the pope’s blasphemous mass-book,
... an abominable and loathsome sacrifice
in the sight of God, even as a
dead dog.” Barrowe was one of the
three Separatist martyrs, and as such
held in deepest veneration at Plymouth.
(Young’s <i>Chron. of Pilg.</i>, pp. 427-34.)
The Book of Common Prayer was therefore
undoubtedly looked upon and referred
to at Plymouth as Morton says.
Indeed, the Lyford schism was in some
degree due to its use. (Bradford, p. 181.)
That it was, in the early days, also so
looked upon and so referred to at Salem
and at Boston, is not clear. It is true
that in 1629 it was again the cause of
the Browne dissension at Salem (Young’s
<i>Chron. of Mass.</i>, p. 287), in consequence
of which Skelton and Higginson both
declared openly “that they came away
from the Common Prayer and ceremonies, ...
and therefore, being in a place
where they might have their liberty,
they neither could nor would use them,
because they judged the imposition of
these things to be sinful corruptions in
the worship of God.” (Morton’s <i>Memorial</i>,
p. 147.) The Puritans of Boston,
however, were not Separatists, and
it is open to question whether they at
first felt towards the Common Prayer
as the Plymouth people felt towards it,
and as Morton says. In 1640 Governor
Winthrop, it is true, noted it as a thing
worthy of observation that his son “having
many books in a chamber where
there was corn of divers sorts, had among
them one wherein the Greek testament,
the psalms and the common prayer were
bound together. He found the common
prayer eaten with mice, every leaf of it,
and not any of the two other touched,
nor any other of his books, though they
were above a thousand.” (Winthrop,
vol. ii. p. *20.) When Governor Winthrop
tried and sentenced Morton, however,
he was anxious to preserve his
connection with the Church of England,
and it is very doubtful whether he then
looked upon its Book of Prayer as “an
idol.” (<i>Proc. Mass. Hist. Soc.</i>, vol. xviii.
p. 296.)
</p>
<p>
As one count in Morton’s indictment
of the people of New England, that in
the text now under consideration was
not only sufficiently well founded, but it
was peculiarly calculated to excite Archbishop
Laud’s anger. It is unnecessary
to say that he was the special champion
of the Church of England ritual. To
enforce exact conformity to it he regarded
as his mission. When the
ships loaded with emigrants for New
England were, in March, 1634, stopped
in the Thames by order of the Privy
Council, they were not allowed to proceed
on their voyage until the masters
bound themselves to have the Book of
Common Prayer used at morning and
evening service during the voyage.
(<i>Council Register</i>, Feb. 21, 28, 1634;
Gardiner’s <i>Charles I.</i>, vol. ii. p. 23.)
This was Laud’s act, and it is more
than probable that he was as much influenced
by Morton on that occasion as
he was subsequently in the matter of
Winslow’s imprisonment for having performed
the marriage ceremony. (<i>Supra</i>,

hypocrites! for ye pay tithe of mint
and anise and cummin, and have omitted
the weightier matters of the law,
judgment, mercy, and faith.” (<i>Matt.</i>
xxiii. 23.)
</p>
<p>
“But woe unto you, Pharisees! for
ye tithe mint and rue and all manner of
herbs, and pass over judgment and the
love of God.” (<i>Luke</i> xi. 42.)
</p>
<p>
The significance of the text referred
to lay, of course, in Morton’s mind, rather
in its indirect than its direct application,&mdash;more
in its denunciatory than
in its contributory portions. The clergy
in early Massachusetts were supported
by the voluntary contributions in Boston,
and by a regular town-tax levy outside
of Boston. (<i>Plaine Dealing</i>, pp.
48-50; <i>Proc. Mass. Hist. Soc.</i>, 1860-2,
p. 116.)</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_558_558" id="Footnote_558_558"></a><a href="#FNanchor_558_558"><span class="label">[558]</span></a> Edward Howes, in writing from
London to John Winthrop, Jr., in November,
1632, describes how, on going
home at noon one day, he met the master
of a vessel which had just arrived
from New England, together with three
others who had come over with him.
The master passing into the house on
some matter of business, Howes had a
talk with one of the other men, whom
he describes as an “egregious knave.”
The report given by this man of the
Massachusetts community strikingly resembles
that given by Morton in this
chapter. He would, writes Howes,
“give none of you a good word, but the
governor [Winthrop]; he was a good
man and kept a good table, but all the
rest were Hereticks, and they would be
more holy than all the world; they
would be a peculiar people to God, but
go to the Devil; that one man with you
being at confession, as he called it, said
he believed his father and mother and
ancestors went all to Hell; and that
your preachers, in their public prayers,
pray for the governor before they pray
for our king and state; ... that you
never use the Lord’s prayer; that your
ministers marry none; that fellows which
keep hogs all the week preach on the
Sabbath; that every town in your plantation
is of a several religion; that you
count all men in England, yea all out
of your church, in the state of damnation.
But I believe and know better
things of you; but here you may partly
see how the Devil stirs up his instruments.”

<p><a name="Footnote_559_559" id="Footnote_559_559"></a><a href="#FNanchor_559_559"><span class="label">[559]</span></a> Mr. Swift (<i>Supra</i>, <a href="#Page_328">328</a>, <i>note</i>) suggests
that Morton here alludes to the
scene in Ben Jonson’s <i>Tale of a Tub</i>
(act iv. sc. 1), where Justice Preamble
says:
</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
     <div class="verse">“And what say you now, neighbor Turfe?”</div>

     <div class="verse indent20">“I put it</div>
     <div class="verse">Even to your worship’s bitterment, hab, nab.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>
Here the Countryman makes the remark,
and not the Justice; but a wholly
correct allusion by Morton is not to be
looked for. (<i>Supra</i>, <a href="#Page_123">123</a>, <i>note</i> 2.) The
meaning of <i>hab, nab</i> is, of course, “hit
or miss, at a venture, at random,” and
is probably derived from <i>habbe, nabbe</i>,&mdash;“to
have or not to have.” (See
Nares’s <i>Glossary</i>.)</p></div>

it was ordered, that “Nantascot shall

Mr. Savage, in his notes to Winthrop
(vol. ii. p. *175), and Mr. Whitmore
(<i>Proc. Mass. Hist. Soc.</i> 1871-3, p. 397),
think it was so called from Hull in
Yorkshire. It would appear from the

that name among the “old planters”
before the settlement of Boston.</p></div>

There are in the <i>New Canaan</i> (<i>Supra</i>,
<a href="#Page_280">280</a>, <a href="#Page_297">297</a>) two references to certain
imaginary or special gifts from “Phaos
box,” which in editing I had been unable
to explain. Mr. Lindsay Swift
(<i>Supra</i>, <a href="#Page_328">328</a>, <i>note</i>) now supplies me with
a reference, which, if it is indeed, as
seems most probable, the allusion which
Morton had in mind, seems to indicate
that his familiarity with classic authors
was greater than I have been disposed
to give him credit for. The reference
is to the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Varia Historia</i> of Ælianus
(lib. <span class="smcap lowercase">XII.</span> cap. xviii.), and reads as follows:
“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Phaonem, omnium hominum formosissimum,
Venus in lactucis abscondit.
Alii dicunt, eum portitorem fuisse,
et habuisse hoc vitæ genus. Veniebat
autem aliquando Venus, trajicere volens;
ille vero, nesciens quænam esset,
libenter recepit, magnaque cura, quoquo
voluerat, eam vexit. Pro quibus
meritis Dea alabastrum ei donavit, et
erat in eo unguentum, quo unctus
Phaon speciosissimus hominum evasit,
atque adeo amarunt eum Mitylenensium
feminæ. Tandem vero deprehensus
in adulterio, trucidatus est.</span>”</p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
